          <attvalue for="7" value="Natural gadolinium displays a number of remarkable physical properties: it is a rare earth element, composed of seven stable or quasi-stable isotopes, with an exceptionally high magnetization and a Curie point near room temperature. Its use in the field of nuclear instrumentation historically relates to its efficiency as a neutron poison in power reactors. Gadolinium is indeed the naturally occurring element with the highest interaction probability with neutrons at thermal energy, shared between Gd-157 (15.65%, 254000 b cross section) and Gd-155 (14.8%, 60900 b) isotopes. Considering that neutron capture results in an isotopic change, followed by a radiative rearrangement of nuclear and atomic structures, Gd may be embodied not merely as a neutron poison but as a neutron converter into a prompt photon and an electron source term. Depending on the nature and energy of the reaction products (from a few-keV Auger electrons up to 8 MeV gamma rays) that the detector aims at isolating as an indirect neutron signature, a variety of sensor media and counting methods have been introduced during the last decades. This review first draws a theoretical description of the radiative cascade following Gd(n,gamma) capture. The cascade may be subdivided into regions of interest, each corresponding to dedicated detection designs and optimizations whose current status is detailed. This inventory has allowed the authors to extract and benchmark key figures of merit for the definition of a detection scheme: neutron attenuation, neutron sensitivity (cps/nv), gamma rejection, neutron detection limit in a mixed field, intrinsic or extrinsic moderation, and transportability. On this basis, the authors have identified promising paths for Gd-based neutron detection in contemporary instrumentation."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Odorant binding proteins (OBPs) are small soluble proteins found in olfactory systems that are capable of binding several types of odorant molecules. Cantilevers based on polycrystalline diamond surfaces are very promising as chemical transducers. Here two methods were investigated for chemically grafting porcine OBPs on polycrystalline diamond surfaces for biosensor development. The first approach resulted in random orientation of the immobilized proteins over the surface. The second approach based on complexing a histidine-tag located on the protein with nickel allowed control of the proteins׳ orientation. Evidence confirming protein grafting was obtained using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, fluorescence imaging and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The chemical sensing performances of these OBP modified transducers were assessed. The second grafting method led to typically 20% more sensitive sensors, as a result of better access of ligands to the proteins active sites and also perhaps a better yield of protein immobilization. This new grafting method appears to be highly promising for further investigation of the ligand binding properties of OBPs in general and for the development of arrays of non-specific biosensors for artificial olfaction applications."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) are point optical fiber sensors that allow the monitoring of a diversity of environmental parameters, e.g., temperature or strain. Several research groups have studied radiation effects on the grating response, as they are implemented in harsh environments: high energy physics, space, and nuclear facilities. We report here the advances made to date in studies regarding the vulnerability and hardening of this sensor under radiation. First, we introduce its principle of operation. Second, the different grating inscription techniques are briefly illustrated as well as the differences among the various types. Then, we focus on the radiation effects induced on different FBGs. Radiation induces a shift in their Bragg wavelengths, which is a property serving to measure environmental parameters. This radiation-induced Bragg wavelength shift (RI-BWS) leads to a measurement error, whose amplitude and kinetics depend on many parameters: inscription conditions, fiber type, pre- or post-treatments, and irradiation conditions (nature, dose, dose rate, and temperature). Indeed, the radiation hardness of an FBG is not directly related to that of the fiber where it has been photo-inscribed by a laser. We review the influence of all these parameters and discuss how it is possible to manufacture FBGs with limited RI-BWS, opening the way to their implementation in radiation-rich environments."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Diamond is wide band gap semiconductor presenting many extreme properties. It is notably known as the most stable material with the highest chemical inertness, the highest mechanical hardness and the highest thermal conductivity. Since the mid 1970s it has been possible to grow synthetic diamond by several methods. High Pressure High Temperature techniques that mimic the diamond formation in the earth's crust were first developed. Then Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) methods enable diamond growth at laboratory scale as well as the control the P-type and N-type doping of diamond. Besides, it is possible to tune the diamond electrical properties form very resistive to metallic thanks to the P-type doping with boron. Current achievements have enabled the development of diamond sensors that can operate in extreme conditions. After being used for its mechanical and thermal properties, diamond was considered for chemical sensing. In fact the chemical stability and the close-to-metallic conductivity of diamond make it a powerful tool for electrochemical detection in various environment. Furthermore, the diamond is an ideal substrate for surface functionalization thanks to the wide and very known carbon based chemistry. Such a feature combined to the outstanding electrochemical properties of the diamond electrodes have enable the production of very efficient biosensors and biochips. Diamond is also an interesting sensor for medical imaging. Its carbon nature, well tolerated by living tissues, are actually very useful for its use as a biosensor capable of working in contact with bio-environments as well as real neuronal interfaces. Both those topics will be discussed in details in the following pages. In a first part an overview on electrochemical based biosensors and their performance is described. Then in a second half of the chapter, novel applications where diamond is directly used as an electrode for neural tissue interfacing is presented in details."/>

Gd-157, Gd-155 and Cd-113 nuclei present the highest cross-sections for thermal neutron capture among natural isotopes. In order to allow for the exploitation of the low and medium-energy radiative signature of the said captures, the contribution of gamma background radiation, falling into the same energy range, needs to be cancelled out. This paper introduces a thermal neutron detector based on a twin-dense semiconductor scheme. The neutron-sensitive channel takes the form of a Gd-covered CdZnTe crystal, a high density and effective atomic number detection medium. The background compensation will be carried out by means of an identical CdZnTe sensor with a Tb cover. The setting of a hypothesis test aims at discriminating the signal generated by the signature of thermal neutron captures in Gd from statistical fluctuations over the compensation of both independent channels. The measurement campaign conducted with an integrated single-channel chain and two metal Gd and Tb covers, under Cs-137 and Cf-252 irradiations, provides first quantitative results on gamma rejection and neutron sensitivity. The described study of concept gives grounds for a portable, online compatible device, operable in conventional to controlled environments."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Electrical potential of nanoparticles under relevant environment is substantial for their applications in electronics as well as sensors and biology. Here, we use Kelvin force microscopy to characterize electrical properties of semiconducting diamond nanoparticles (DNPs) of 5-10 nm nominal size and metallic gold nanoparticles (20 and 40 nm) on Si and Au substrates under ambient conditions. The DNPs are deposited on Si and Au substrates from dispersions with well-defined zeta-potential. We show that the nanoparticle potential depends on its size and that the only reliable potential characteristic is a linear fit of this dependence within a 5-50 nm range. Systematically different potentials of hydrogenated, oxidized, and graphitized DNPs are resolved using this methodology. The differences are within 50 mV, that is much lower than on monocrystalline diamond. Furthermore, all of the nanoparticles assume their potential within -60 mV according to the Au and Si substrate, thus gaining up to 0.4 V difference. This effect is attributed to DNP charging by charge transfer and/or polarization. This is confirmed by secondary electron emission. Such effects are general with broad implications for nanoparticles applications."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="A biologically inspired approach to learning temporally correlated patterns from a spiking silicon retina is presented. Spikes are generated from the retina in response to relative changes in illumination at the pixel level and transmitted to a feed-forward spiking neural network. Neurons become sensitive to patterns of pixels with correlated activation times, in a fully unsupervised scheme. This is achieved using a special form of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity which depresses synapses that did not recently contribute to the post-synaptic spike activation, regardless of their activation time. Competitive learning is implemented with lateral inhibition. When tested with real-life data, the system is able to extract complex and overlapping temporally correlated features such as car trajectories on a freeway, after only 10 min of traffic learning. Complete trajectories can be learned with a 98% detection rate using a second layer, still with unsupervised learning, and the system may be used as a car counter. The proposed neural network is extremely robust to noise and it can tolerate a high degree of synaptic and neuronal variability with little impact on performance. Such results show that a simple biologically inspired unsupervised learning scheme is capable of generating selectivity to complex meaningful events on the basis of relatively little sensory experience."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Recent use of very small photon beams (down to 4 mm) in stereotactic radiotherapy requires new detectors to accurately determine the delivered dose. Diamond detectors have been presented in the literature as an attractive candidate for this application, due to their small detection volume and the diamond atomic number (Z = 6) which is close to water effective atomic number (Zeff ∼ 7.42). However, diamond exhibits a density 3.51 times greater than that of water and recent studies using Monte Carlo simulations have demonstrated the drawback of a high-density detector on small beam output factors. The current study focuses on geometrical parameters of diamond detector, namely, the diamond dimensions and the electrode geometry, in order to solve the dosimetric issues still observed in small photon beams with diamond detectors. To give better insights to these open questions, we have used both computational method and experimental analysis. This study highlighted that reducing diamond dimensions is crucial for small beam output factor measurements and to limit the influence of its high density. Furthermore, electrodes covering the whole diamond surface were essential for a dose rate independence of the diamond detector. The optimal dosimeter derived from this work presented small diamond dimensions of approximately 1 × 1 × 0.15 mm$^3$, with diamond-like-carbon electrodes covering the whole diamond surface. A dose rate independence of this diamond detector (better than 0.5% over a wide range of dose rates available on a stereotactic dedicated facility) was obtained due to the electrode geometry. Concerning the output factor measurements, a good agreement (better than 1.1%) was observed between this carbon material detector and two types of passive dosimeters (LiF microcubes and EBT2 radiochromic films) for all beam sizes except the smallest field of 0.6 × 0.6 cm$^2$ with a deviation of 2.6%. This new study showed the high performance of this diamond detector in small photon beams, in comparison with various commercially available passive and active dosimeters."/>

For this, a boron doped diamond detector window is negatively polarized to produce a basic layer on its surface by water decomposition. Actinides elements that are known to be very sensitive to hydrolysis are precipitated as solid hydroxides onto the entrance window of the sensor. Due to the absence of an air layer between the radioactive source and the detector, there is no need for vacuum during the alpha spectrometry measurement. After analysis, the detector can be easily cleaned by anodization in the aqueous medium to be reused at once. The minimum detectable activity concentration (MDA) of the system has been evaluated with 241Am at 0.5 Bq/L for a 0.33 cm2 area Si PIN diode."/>

The aim of this development is the use of this method for the Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of critical structures with heavy limitations on both sensor's intrusiveness and diagnostic's reliability because it allows to use sensors that cannot emit elastic waves such as Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) which are less intrusive than piezoelectric transducers (PZTs). The idea consists in using passive methods in order to retrieve the impulse response from elastic diffuse fields-naturally present in structures-measured simultaneously between the sensors. In this paper, two passive methods are studied: the ambient noise cross-correlation and the passive inverse filter. Once all the impulse responses between the sensors are retrieved, they are used as input data to perform guided wave tomography."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Recent developments of new therapy techniques using small photon beams, such as stereotactic radiotherapy, require suitable detectors to determine the delivered dose with a high accuracy. The dosimeter has to be as close as possible to tissue equivalence and to exhibit a small detection volume compared to the size of the irradiation field, because of the lack of lateral electronic equilibrium in small beam. Characteristics of single crystal diamond (tissue equivalent material Z = 6, high density) make it an ideal candidate to fulfil most of small beam dosimetry requirements. A commercially available Element Six electronic grade synthetic diamond was used to develop a single crystal diamond dosimeter (SCDDo) with a small detection volume (0.165 mm3). Long term stability was studied by irradiating the SCDDo in a 60Co beam over 14 h. A good stability (deviation less than ± 0.1%) was observed. Repeatability, dose linearity, dose rate dependence and energy dependence were studied in a 10 × 10 cm2 beam produced by a Varian Clinac 2100 C linear accelerator. SCDDo lateral dose profile, depth dose curve and output factor (OF) measurements were performed for small photon beams with a micro multileaf collimator m3 (BrainLab) attached to the linac. This study is focused on the comparison of SCDDo measurements to those obtained with different commercially available active detectors: an unshielded silicon diode (PTW 60017), a shielded silicon diode (Sun Nuclear EDGE), a PinPoint ionization chamber (PTW 31014) and two natural diamond detectors (PTW 60003). SCDDo presents an excellent spatial resolution for dose profile measurements, due to its small detection volume. Low energy dependence (variation of 1.2% between 6 and 18 MV photon beam) and low dose rate dependence of the SCDDo (variation of 1% between 0.53 and 2.64 Gy min−1) are obtained, explaining the good agreement between the SCDDo and the efficient unshielded diode (PTW 60017) in depth dose curve measurements. For field sizes ranging from 0.6 × 0.6 to 10 × 10 cm2 , OFs obtained with the SCDDo are between the OFs measured with the PinPoint ionization chamber and the Sun Nuclear EDGE diode that are known to respectively underestimate and overestimate OF values in small beam, due to the large detection volume of the chamber and the non-water equivalence of both detectors"/>

The proposed solution allows the three force components and the three torque components to be measured simultaneously and can be inserted into an interface handle or a robot end-effector. The information on wrench can then be used to detect and control interactions for cooperative tasks between humans and robots. In the context of sensors for robotic co-manipulation, it is imperative to guarantee not only a certain level of performance (accuracy, dynamics, size) but also to guarantee certain non-functional specifications associated with safety, measurement redundancy or functional integration of the sensor into its environment. The consideration of all these design specifications, both functional and non-functional, led to the principles and technologies used to develop this sensor. Multi-axis resonant sensors have excellent performance and safety characteristics, two key elements for collaborative robotics, but the literature review did not reveal any significant previous work in this area. Thus, this paper proposes an original sensor based on a breakthrough technology in the crucial field of multi-axis force sensors. The performances obtained on our prototype are already close to the performances of the best existing 6-axis industrial sensors, which suggests very good prospects for this new technology. In addition, and compared to alternative technologies, resonance technology offers new possibilities in terms of sensor fault detection, thus improving the intrinsic safety of these devices."/>

This approach is based on the use of a novel device consisting of a boron doped nanocrystalline diamond film deposited onto a silicon PIN diode alpha particle sensor. The actinides concentration is probed in situ in the measuring solution using a method based on electro-precipitation that can be carried out via the use of a doped diamond electrode. The device allows probing directly both alpha-particles activity and energy in liquid solutions. In this work, we address the optimization of the actinides electro-precipitation step onto the sensor. The approach is based on fine tuning the pH of the electrolyte, the nature of the supporting electrolytes (Na 2 SO 4 or NaNO 3 ), the electrochemical cell geometry, the current density value, the precipitation duration as well as the sensor surface area. The deposition efficiency was significantly improved with values reaching for instance up to 81.5% in the case of electro-precipitation of 5.96 Bq 241 Am on the sensor. The diamond/silicon sensor can be reused after measurement by performing a fast decontamination step at high yields ≥99%, where the 241 Am electro-precipitated layer is quickly removed by applying an anodic current (+2 mA · cm -2 for 10 minutes) to the boron doped nanocrystalline diamond electrode in aqueous solution. This study demonstrated that alpha-particle spectroscopic measurements could be made feasible for the first time in aqueous solutions after an electrochemical deposition process, with theoretical detections thresholds as low as 0.24 Bq · L -1 . We believe that this approach can be of very high interest for alpha-particle spectroscopy in liquids for actinides trace detection."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="When considering force-controlled robots, one key-point to sense the arm-environment interaction is the availability of cheap but sufficiently precise multi-axis force sensors. Even if resonant sensors can overcome some well-known limitations such as noise and drift issues, designing multi-axial resonant force sensor is still non-intuitive due to dynamical nature and multiple modes interaction. This paper presents the development of an integrated three-component force sensing resonant structure, which may be used to simultaneously estimate, all the three components of the force applied on it, for the first time. The sensor principle relies on one single pre-stress composite plate where actuation and measurement are achieved with piezoelectric transducers. Feedback control based on Phase-Locked Loop is used to measure resonances, then estimate the applied forces. Multiple smart design strategies, such as modal superposition, spatial modal filtering using optimal transducers placement and intelligent signal conditioning, limit the electronic treatment and reduce the controller complexity. Experimental comparisons with other calibrated force sensors have shown that the applied force can be efficiently estimated with accuracy, demonstrating the interest of our approach to design integrated and inexpensive multi-axis force sensor solution for robotic applications."/>

Here, the fabrication of microelectrode arrays (MEAs) with boron-doped nanocrystalline diamond (BNCD) electrodes and their interfacing with cardiomyocyte-like HL-1 cells to detect cardiac action potentials are presented. A non-reductive means of structuring doped and undoped diamond on the same substrate is shown. The resulting BNCD electrodes show high stability under mechanical stress generated by the cells.

In typical applications such as monitoring delaminations in aircraft fuselage, a network made of piezoelectric transducer (PZT) is used to emit and receive such waves in the structure. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors on optical fibers are a promising alternative to PZT for guided waves measurements in practical applications due to the capacity for dense multiplexing and robustness with respect to the environment. However, unlike conventional PZT transducers, FBG sensors cannot emit waves. It is demonstrated here that FBG sensors can be used in combination with a passive diffuse noise cross-correlation technique in order to extract the coherent guided waves propagating between two sensors. This could lead to a system using only FBG sensors in the near future. The reconstructed signals can then be analyzed with usual guided waves algorithms, like in active SHM systems, keeping all the advantages of this kind of monitoring in terms of fine diagnosis. The experimental demonstration shown in this paper is performed at ultrasonic frequencies (20-100 kHz) typically used in guided waves based SHM systems showing the potential of the approach."/>

The radiation sensor, comprising two volumes of scintillating polymers, it is, by nature, sensitive to both neutron and gamma radiations. This allows the design of a versatile n/$\gamma$ detector, provided that it is possible to algorithmically separate the signature of both types of radiations. After amplitude and gamma–gamma coincidence filtering, the authors investigate a third n/$\gamma$ discrimination mode by proton–gamma temporal correlation filtering. After a bibliographic study, the article details the estimation of the temporal parameter useful for such a discrimination, firstly by explicit calculations, secondly by means of a MCNP6.1-based, dedicated simulator. A time-based-processing firmware, embedded into a pulse acquisition card, was then created to compare these estimates with experimental distributions. A 50-$\mu$s temporal gate was identified as relevant to discriminate temporal correlations in presence of a neutron emitter. A compensation technique was eventually implemented in order to obtain first experimental estimates of neutron sensitivity, and neutron detections limits in a mixed field. The study ends up providing a maximum reachable sensitivity in the order of 0.3 c.n$^{−1}$.cm$^2$ under a fast neutron flux (AmBe), with two 1-L plastic scintillators separated by a 250-$\mu$m Gd converter, and the associated temporal correlation and compensation algorithm, as well as neutron detection limits in the same order as those of a He-3 Bonner sphere over acquisition times between 1 and 10 min."/>

Based on single-crystal CVD (scCVD) super-thin diamond membranes obtained using deep Ar/O$_2$ plasma etching, prototypes of solid-state microdosimeters for lineal energy measurements are produced at the Diamond Sensors Laboratory of CEA-LIST. The response of a diamond membrane microdosimeter to single projectiles is investigated in ion microbeams. The microdosimeter is irradiated using a raster scanning method and the charge transport properties of the device are determined with sub-micron precision by measuring the charge collection efficiency (CCE), the μSVs 3D spatial definition and the pulse-height spectra. A prototype of this novel microdosimeter is then tested in a 100 MeV therapeutic proton beam at the Institute Curie − Proton Therapy Centre in Orsay.

The role of diamond nano-particles is to offer a stable sp3 carbon porous matrix onto which the metalloporphyrin receptor is immobilised. This functionalised matrix can then be deposited by a layer-by-layer deposition method homogeneously on the transducer surface while featuring a high surface area. Good repeatability was obtained from sensor to sensor. The resulting sensors show a very high sensitivity of typically 120 Hz ppb−1 with a limit of detection (LOD) at 1 ppb level towards 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) vapours, a tracer for explosive trinitrotoluene (TNT). The response is enhanced by more than a factor 10 when using diamond nano-particles as opposed to a transducer with only the metalloporphyrin complex deposited on the surface. The response time t90% is approximately 4 min and the sensor response is fully reversible. The cross-sensitivity of the sensor is low when exposed to polar compounds such as ethanol or moisture. Those results are encouraging towards the development of low cost portable explosive vapour detectors. Furthermore, the carbon terminated surface of diamond nano-particles offers wide opportunities for grafting other types or receptors for chemical or biological gravimetric detection."/>

The oldest applications of diamond are certainly related to its mechanical properties, in particular its hardness, which has facilitated its use for cutting and polishing, and in drilling tools. The chemical resilience of diamond associated with its interesting semiconducting properties has also been exploited for the development of radiation detectors. In this chapter we focus on chemical or biochemical sensing applications. Here, the extreme properties of diamond, being chemical, electrochemical, optical, acoustic, and so forth, have more recently prompted excitement for the development of innovative sensors. The various forms of diamond, from particles at the nanoscale to bulk single crystals, exhibit real potential to enhance both the sensing performance of the devices and their robustness, as well as their reliability in field-operating conditions. A wide range of diamond-based chemical sensors have been reported in the form of solid state semiconductor sensors, field effect transistors, electrodes, etc. both in the gas phase and in the liquid phase. Such sensors have found various applications in environmental monitoring, security and medical diagnostics. Two types of transducer technologies, namely acoustic wave devices and cantilevers, are particularly interesting because they offer the possibility of high sensitivity detection of a wide range of analytes at a potentially low cost with a high level of miniaturisation. This chapter gives an insight into how these technologies may benefit from the exceptional assets of diamond materials through a few examples, ranging from DNA detection to artificial olfaction."/>

As an alternative to the existing strain-gauges force sensors, this paper presents a resonant composite structure, which is sensitive to multiple components of force that are considered via the pre-stress effect. Structurally bonded piezoelectric patches are used to bring the structure to its resonance, which is shifted according to applied forces. The relationship between force and frequency shift is modelled considering the multi-physics of this smart structure. This model is built using Hamiltons principle and takes into account pre-stress phenomena. A finite element model (FEM) based on Mindlin theory for plates, has been derived from the analytical model. The FEM model is implemented in MATLAB and compared with commercial FE software. Finally, an experimental prototype validates the model, and shows that it is possible to measure multiple force-components with one single sensing element such as a plate."/>

A spiking neural network capable of performing multilayer unsuper-vised learning through Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity is introduced. It shows exceptional performances at detecting cars passing on a freeway recorded with a dynamic vision sensor, after only 10 minutes of fully unsupervised learning. Our methodology is thoroughly explained and first applied to a simpler example of ball trajectory learning. Two unsuper-vised learning strategies are investigated for advanced features learning. Robustness of our network to synaptic and neuron variability is assessed and virtual immunity to noise and jitter is demonstrated."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="CEA LIST is working on the development of a high-sensitivity thermal neutron counter, based on the insertion of gadolinium in spherical plastic scintillators. As the radiation sensor comprises one or several volumes of scintillating polymers, it is, by nature, sensitive to both neutron and gamma radiations. This property allows the development of a versatile detector, provided that it is possible to algorithmically separate the signature of both types of radiations. The technologically building brick is, moreover, to be implemented in a transportable (&lt;15 kg) system, handled by a first intervention task force in an exposed area. The aim of this paper is to study, both through Monte Carlo simulation and experimentally, an algorithmic architecture of the measurement chain discriminating neutron and gamma events. The presentation is subdivided in three main sections. First, we detail a comparative study between the outputs of a numerical modeling tool, developed to simulate the total response of the sensor to varying radiation sources and the results of a series of experiments carried out in a controlled environment. Second, we describe the building and numerical pre-validation of a simulation code dedicated to the study of consolidated algorithmic architecture, namely γ–γ quasi-coincidence on two adjacent plastic scintillators. Third, we comment on an experimental study of γ–γ quasi-coincidence, Gd-based neutron detection and a comparison between the results and the estimated of the numerical study. We conclude with the presentation of first estimates of neutron sensitivity), gamma-background vulnerability, and n/γ discrimination ratio for the scaled and assessed, material and algorithmic architectures."/>

In the context of Automotive and IoT, low cost image sensors, with high quality pixels, will embed more and more smart functions, such as the regular low level image processing but also object recognition, movement detection, light detection, etc. 3D technology is a key enabler technology to integrate into a single device the pixel layer and associated acquisition layer, but also the smart computing features and the required amount of memory to process all the acquired data. More computing and memory within the 3D Smart Image Sensors will bring new features and reduce the overall system power consumption. Advanced 3D technology with ultra-fine pitch vertical interconnect density will pave the way towards new architectures for 3D Smart Image Sensors, allowing local vertical communication between pixels, and the associated computing and memory structures. The presentation will give an overview of recent 3D technologies solutions, such as Hybrid Bonding technology and the Monolithic 3D CoolCube™ technology, with respective 3D interconnect pitch in the order of 1 μm and l00nm. Recent 3D Image Sensors will be presented, showing the capability of 3D technology to implement fine grain pixel acquisition and processing with ultra-high speed image acquisition and tile-based processing. As further perspectives, multi-layer 3D image sensor based on events and spiking will reduce power consumption with new detection and learning processing capabilities."/>

The heterogeneous nature of IoT communications and imbalance in resource capabilities between IoT entities make it challenging to provide the required end-to-end secured connections. Clarifying how existing security protocols can be adapted to fulfill these new challenges still has to be improved. A direct use of existing key exchange schemes between two IoT entities may be unfeasible unless both entities be able to run the resource consuming cryptographic primitives required to bootstrap them - thus leaving aside a whole class of resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we revisit existing end-to-end security standards and key establishment schemes and discuss their limitations considering the specific scenarios of the IoT. Later, we propose novel collaborative approaches for key establishment designed to reduce the requirements of these existing security protocols. A constrained device may delegate its heavy cryptographic load to less constrained nodes in neighbourhood exploiting the spatial heterogeneity of IoT environment. We demonstrate through a performance analysis that our collaborative key establishment solution allows for a reduction in energy consumption at the constrained device by up to 80% in comparison with existing key establishment schemes."/>

We study thermally oxidized detonation DNPs of 5nm nominal size. The nanoparticles were deposited from diluted water solutions on a Si substrate half coated with Au. The KFM using conductive Si tip resolved characteristic negative potential differences of 10-60mV on nanoparticles versus the substrate. When negative bias voltage to the KFM tip (-4V) is applied during the topography acquisition (the first pass), subsequent potential measurement (the second pass) shows inversion of nanoparticles potential contrast. The same effects were observed also in the case of 20nm colloidal Au nanoparticles. This effect is reversible and it is attributed to a charge retention in (or on) the nanoparticles."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="In guided wave (GW)-based structural health monitoring (SHM), ultrasonic elastic waves are used to detect damages in structures by comparing the acquired signals with those acquired before defect formation. Making the SHM system automatic, especially for similar structures, such as turbine blades, is rather challenging. The high sensitivity of GWs to environmental and operational conditions, the variabilities due to sensor positioning, sensor coupling, and material variability in composites limit the baseline application. This work presents a machine learning (ML)-based damage detection method using aggregated baselines independent of their damaged states to enhance the generalization capability of ML algorithms by considering similar structures’ variabilities. The methodology relies on feature extraction from raw GW signals and training classification algorithms (e.g., kernel machines, ensemble methods, and neural networks). Two experimental data sets on composite panels are used. The first experimental data set of 45 composite panels is used to validate the approach by considering the aforementioned inter-specimen variabilities. Half of the 45 panels provide pristine data, and the rest provide damaged data so that the same sample is present in the training or test set but never in both. High classification performance is obtained, demonstrating that the classifier has successfully learned to recognize defect signatures despite the influence of the variabilities linked to the multiple instrumented specimens. The second experimental data set of 1 composite panel with temperature variation is used. Good classification performance is obtained without using baseline correction methods."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) are gaining acceptance as velocity/pressure gauges in the fields of detonation and shock physics on account of their sensitivity, small size, flexibility, electromagnetic immunity, and wavelength-encoded feature. Chirped FBGs (CFBGs) are investigated as wavelength-to-position discriminators with the purpose of monitoring pressure/velocity profiles over a distance range of typically 100 mm. The use of CFBGs simplifies both sensor deployment and data retrieval and finally improves the accuracy due to the increased number of measurement data. In this paper, the metrological performance of CFBGs used as in situ distributed shock pressure/velocity gauges is investigated both theoretically and experimentally in a planar shock loading configuration with an aluminum-based flyer and target. In the intermediate range for shock stress, i.e., less than the Hugoniot Elastic Limit (HEL) of silica, CFBGs provide simultaneous measurements of both shockwave velocity and stress within the target material. A Bragg wavelength-to-stress model is proposed that takes into account (i) the state-of-stress within the target material, (ii) the stress coupling coefficient due to imperfect impedance matching between the target material and the silica fiber, (iii) the conversion of the state-of-stress into a state-of-strain within the silica fiber, and (iv) the conversion of strain data into observable Bragg wavelength shifts. Finally, the model also takes into account the pressure dependence of constitutive parameters for silica and aluminum. Experiments were performed in planar shock loading using CFBGs as stress gauges, bonded along the target axis with Araldite glue. 6061-T6 aluminum flyers were launched at several velocities by a gas gun onto targets of the same material. A free-space Czerny-Turner (CT) spectrometer and an integrated-optics Arrayed-Waveguide Grating (AWG) were both used as dynamic spectrum analyzers. Experimental Bragg wavelength shifts agree well with theoretical predictions for both elastic and hydrodynamic planar shock loading of 6061-T6 aluminum, opening up large perspectives for shock physics experiments."/>

OSL fibre sensors incorporating small Al2 O3 :C fibre crystals (TLD500 ) have been tested with an X-ray generator. A reproducible readout procedure should reduce the fading-induced uncertainty (~ 1% per decade). OSL readouts are temperature-dependent [~0.3% K^-1 when OSL stimulation is performed at the same temperature as irradiation; ~ 0.16% K^-1 after thermalisation (20°C)]. Sensor calibration and depth–dose measurements with electron beams have been performed with a Saturne 43 linear accelerator in reference conditions at CEA-LNHB (ionising radiation reference laboratory in France). Predosed OSL sensors show a good repeatability in multichannel operation and independence versus electron energy in the range (9, 18 MeV). The difference between absorbed doses measured by OSL and an ionisation chamber were within pm 0.9% (for a dose of about 1 Gy) despite a sublinear calibration curve."/>

On-line diagnosis aims at detecting and locating faults accurately while the target system is running. In this work, a new reflectometry method, named 'Orthogonal Multi-Tone Time Domain Reflectometry' (OMTDR), is proposed. OMTDR, based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), is a suitable candidate for on-line diagnosis as it permits interference avoidance, bandwidth control and data rate increase thanks to the use of orthogonal tones and guard intervals. Over the diagnosis function, OMTDR adds communication between sensors to more accurately determine faults position in a multi-branch network using a distributed strategy. OMTDR was tested on a branched network consisting of three cables with different lengths, with sensors at each cable end. Here, the sensors signals are carefully constructed using a resource allocation scheme to use frequencies below and above the prohibited bandwidth, used by the target system, for communication and diagnosis. Simulation results show that the proposed method performs well in a branched wiring network as it permits to detect and locate faults accurately even when the target system is operating."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Abstract In this paper, we specifically address the problem of securing distributed multimedia systems, based on networked tiny devices (i.e., Internet of Things). Such systems have usually to deal with three antagonistic constraints: (a) the hardware limitations of the devices in terms of computational power, memory storage and energy provision as they are driven by batteries, (b) the intrinsic voluminous and time sensitive nature of the captured multimedia data, and (c) their relative vulnerability to attacks since they are open platforms communicating through unreliable wireless radio communications. We propose and study a novel integrated approach, specifically tailored to significantly reduce the size of the transmitted multimedia data whilst ensuring its content confidentiality. In opposition to traditional approaches, based on cryptographic systems which inquire a huge overhead when applied to multimedia data, our approach makes use of Voronoi tessellation to transform the input data. This transformation, performed on a random fashion basis, allows both significant data reduction and content confidentiality as well, while it exhibits a very low complexity. We performed an in-depth security analysis of our proposal that reveals its robustness against all known types of attacks. Moreover, we conducted an extensive series of simulations, based on realistic settings, to show the effectiveness of our approach over state-of-the-art approaches, in the context of Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) applications."/>

The GR microdosimeter was irradiated by a raster scanning method with 2 MeV proton microbeams. The charge transport properties of the GR sensor were determined with sub-micron spatial resolution by measuring the charge collection efficiency (CCE), the μSV geometry, and the pulse-height spectra. The response of the microdosimeter showed a well-defined and homogeneously active μSV. Appropriate biasing of the μSV structures led toward a full CCE for protons with lineal energies of ∼46 keV/μm. This shows the GR microdosimeter’s great potential for applications in microdosimetry in clinical beam conditions."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="This paper reports the testing results of radiation resistant fiber Bragg grating (FBG) in random air-line (RAL) fibers in comparison with FBGs in other radiation-hardened fibers. FBGs in RAL fibers were fabricated by 80 fs ultrafast laser pulse using a phase mask approach. The fiber Bragg gratings tests were carried out in the core region of a 6 MW MIT research reactor (MITR) at a steady temperature above 600°C and an average fast neutron (>1 MeV) flux >1.2 × 10$^{14}$ n/cm$^2$/s. Fifty five-day tests of FBG sensors showed less than 5 dB reduction in FBG peak strength after over 1 × 10$^{20}$ n/cm$^2$ of accumulated fast neutron dose. The radiation-induced compaction of FBG sensors produced less than 5.5 nm FBG wavelength shift toward shorter wavelength. To test temporal responses of FBG sensors, a number of reactor anomaly events were artificially created to abruptly change reactor power, temperature, and neutron flux over short periods of time. The thermal sensitivity and temporal responses of FBGs were determined at different accumulated doses of neutron flux. Results presented in this paper reveal that temperature-stable Type-II FBGs fabricated in radiation-hardened fibers can survive harsh in-pile conditions. Despite large parameter drift induced by strong nuclear radiation, further engineering and innovation on both optical fibers and fiber devices could lead to useful fiber sensors for various in-pile measurements to improve safety and efficiency of existing and next generation nuclear reactors."/>

OR7D4 was grafted through covalent bonding of hexanoic acid radical on diamond followed by EDC/NHS peptidic coupling to the receptor. Both grafting procedures were monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on boron doped diamond (BDD) electrodes. Then the grafting protocols were applied to the surface of bulk diamond micro-cantilevers. The resulting sensors were assessed for odorant detection in the liquid phase using a Laser Doppler read-out system. The 6His-M71 based sensor was found to exhibit a good sensitivity to acetophenone, with a typical frequency shift near 100 Hz for 1 μM exposure, with a good selectivity against negative control 2-octanone. The OR7D4 based sensor showed a sensitivity of 200 Hz for exposures to 1 or 10 μM androstenone with a good selectivity against both non-ligands acetophenone and 2-octanone."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) is a standard key management protocol, used to set up common secrets between any two parties for multiple scenarios of communications. As MIKEY becomes widely deployed, it becomes worthwhile to not confine its applications to real-time or other specific applications, but also to extend the standard to other scenarios as well. For instance, MIKEY can be used to secure key establishment in the Internet of Things. In this particular context, Elliptic Curve Cryptography-based (ECC) algorithms seem to be good candidate to be employed by MIKEY, since they can support equivalent security level when compared with other recommended cryptographic algorithms like RSA, and at the same time requiring smaller key sizes and offering better performance. In this work, we propose novel lightweight ECC-based key distribution extensions for MIKEY that are built upon a previously proposed certificateless signcryption scheme. To our knowledge, these extensions are the first ECC-based MIKEY extensions that employ signcryption schemes. Our proposed extensions benefit from the lightness of the signcryption scheme, while being discharged from the burden of the public key infrastructure (PKI) thanks to its certificateless feature. To demonstrate their performance, we implemented our proposed extensions in the Openmote sensor platform and conducted a thorough performance assessment by measuring the energy consumption and execution time of each operation in the key establishment procedure. The experimental results prove that our new MIKEY extensions are perfectly suited for resource-constrained devices"/>

The amplitudes and kinetics of these radiation induced changes depend on numerous parameters, intrinsic or extrinsic to the FBGs themselves. In this paper, we characterized 40 keV X-ray radiation effects on type I FBGs inscribed in prehydrogenated SMF-28 from Corning through an ultraviolet laser exposure at 244 nm (cw). We performed a systematic study of the influence of several FBG manufacturing parameters on their radiation response up to 100 kGy (SiO2) highlighting radiation-induced Bragg wavelength shifts (RI-BWS) up to 130 pm (~13°C error for temperature measurements) but no decrease of those FBG reflectivity. Among the investigated parameters are the duration and temperature (100°C and 300°C) of the thermal treatments applied post-inscription to stabilize the FBG and to complete the H2 outgassing. For such type of FBG, the device has to be recoated after inscription; we then characterize the impact of this manufacturing step on the FBG response showing that its recoating with NOA-81 acrylate slightly degrades its radiation resistance. In addition to this study, the influence of two other parameters have also been characterized: RI-BWS increases with the dose rate in the range 1-50 Gy/s and a pre-irradiation at 1.5 MGy does not stabilize type I FBG response to a second irradiation."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="In the context of Guided Wave-based Structural Health Monitoring (GW-SHM), ultrasonic elastic waves are used to detect damages in structures by comparing the acquired signals with those from a defectfree structure. However, the high sensitivity of GWs to environmental and operational conditions limits the validity of such references. Notably, variabilities between multiple specimens are often significant from the GWs perspective. These variabilities are particularly important in composites and are due to sensor positioning, sensor coupling and material variability. This communication presents a baseline-free approach using physics-enhanced Machine Learning (ML) for enhanced robustness. To ensure the coverage of these variabilities the approach is validated on multiple Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP) panels. The methodology relies on feature extraction from raw GW signals and training classification algorithms (e.g., kernel machines, neural networks). To make the classifier learn inter-specimen variabilities, an experimental database of 45 impacted composite panels is used. Half of them are used to provide pristine data, and the rest to provide damaged data so that the same sample is either in the training or test set, but never in both. Good classification performance is obtained, demonstrating that the classifier has successfully learnt to recognize defect signatures despite the variability linked to the multiple specimens and instrumentations."/>

The literature presents different approaches and methods to implement visual-based SLAM systems. Among this variety of publications, a beginner in this domain may find problems with identifying and analyzing the main algorithms and selecting the most appropriate one according to his or her project constraints. Therefore, we present the three main visual-based SLAM approaches (visual-only, visual-inertial, and RGB-D SLAM), providing a review of the main algorithms of each approach through diagrams and flowcharts, and highlighting the main advantages and disadvantages of each technique. Furthermore, we propose six criteria that ease the SLAM algorithm’s analysis and consider both the software and hardware levels. In addition, we present some major issues and future directions on visual-SLAM field, and provide a general overview of some of the existing benchmark datasets.

The dose response of OSL integrals under photon beam irradiation (6, 12, and 20 MV) show sublinearity behavior modeled by second-order equations and exhibit a small energy dependence (between 0.7% and 1.4%), explained by a modified intermediate cavity model adapted to a LINAC photon spectrum.

          <attvalue for="7" value="Resonant microcantilevers have demonstrated that they can play an important role in the detection of chemical and biological agents. Molecular interactions with target species on the mechanical microtransducers surface generally induce a change of the beam's bending stiffness, resulting in a shift of the resonance frequency. In most biochemical sensor applications, cantilevers must operate in liquid, even though damping deteriorates the vibrational performances of the transducers. Here we focus on diamond-based microcantilevers since their transducing properties surpass those of other materials. In fact, among a wide range of remarkable features, diamond possesses exceptional mechanical properties enabling the fabrication of cantilever beams with higher resonant frequencies and Q-factors than when made from other conventional materials. Therefore, they appear as one of the top-ranked materials for designing cantilevers operating in liquid media. In this study, we evaluate the resonator sensitivity performances of our diamond microcantilevers using grafted carboxylated alkyl chains as a tool to investigate the subtle changes of surface stiffness as induced by electrostatic interactions. Here, caproic acid was immobilized on the hydrogen-terminated surface of resonant polycrystalline diamond cantilevers using a novel one-step grafting technique that could be also adapted to several other functionalizations. By varying the pH of the solution one could tune the -COO(-)/-COOH ratio of carboxylic acid moieties immobilized on the surface, thus enabling fine variations of the surface stress. We were able to probe the cantilevers resonance frequency evolution and correlate it with the ratio of -COO(-)/-COOH terminations on the functionalized diamond surface and consequently the evolution of the electrostatic potential over the cantilever surface. The approach successfully enabled one to probe variations in cantilevers bending stiffness from several tens to hundreds of millinewtons/meter, thus opening the way for diamond microcantilevers to direct sensing applications in liquids. The evolution of the diamond surface chemistry was also investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy."/>

The objective of this paper is to develop a new embedded diagnosis strategy in complex wired networks that would resolve interference problems and eliminate ambiguities related to fault location. To do so, OMTDR (Orthogonal Multi-tone Time Domain Reflectometry) method is used. For better coverage of the network, communication between sensors is integrated using the transmitted part of the OMTDR signal. It enables data control and transmission for fusion to facilitate fault location. In order to overcome degradation of diagnosis reliability and communication quality, we propose a new sensor clustering strategy based on network topology in terms of distance and number of junctions. Based on CAN bus network, we prove that data fusion using sensor clustering strategy permits to improve the diagnosis performance."/>

They are hosting cumulated lengths of electrical cables that are subject one day or another to the occurrence of wiring faults. Accordingly, wire diagnosis became essentially important for ensuring safety, security, integrity, and optimal performance. On the other hand, the emergence of sensor networks and connected objects has created the need for embedded and non invasive fault diagnosis solutions. Notably, multi-carrier reflectometry methods have shown promising and efficient results in locating upcoming defects on wires in an online manner. Nevertheless, their precision stays within the physical limits of their components, especially the sampling frequency of their analog/digital transitions. In this paper, we will propose several approaches combining multi-carrier reflectometry with phase analysis techniques to overcome this limit. Accordingly, an improvement in the precision of the fault localization and a high spatial resolution is obtained. Based on an FPGA implementation, our novel methods and the resulting systems have proven a five-time better accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods on the same platform."/>

During the course of irradiation, a portion of electrons is trapped within the Al$_2$O$_3$:C crystal while another portion recombines and generates RL, recorded on-line using an optical fiber. The RL sensitivity is dose-dependent and increases in accordance with the concentration of trapped electrons. Once irradiation is completed, the Al$_2$O$_3$:C crystal is reset by laser light (reusable) and the resultant OSL (Optically Stimulated Luminescence) is also collected back by the remote RL-OSL reader and finally integrated to yield the absorbed dose. During irradiation, scintillation and Cerenkov lights generated within the optical fiber (“stem effect”) are removed by a time-discrimination method involving a discriminating unit and a fiber-coupled BGO scintillator placed in the irradiation room, next to the LINAC. The RL signals were then calibrated with respect to reference dose and dose rate data using an ionization chamber (IC). The algorithm relies upon the integral of the RL and provides the accumulated dose (useful to the medical physicist) at any time during irradiation, the dose rate being derived afterwards. It is tested with both step and arbitrary dose rate profiles, manually operated from the LINAC control desk. The doses measured by RL and OSL are both compared to reference doses and deviations are about ±2% and ±1% respectively, thus demonstrating the reliability of the algorithm for arbitrary profiles and wide range of dose rates.

Enabled by their in-memory event-driven computing abilities, hybrid memristive-Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor neuromorphic architectures provide an ideal hardware substrate for such tasks. To demonstrate the full potential of such systems, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an end-to-end sensory processing solution for a real-world object localization application. Drawing inspiration from the barn owl’s neuroanatomy, we developed a bio-inspired, event-driven object localization system that couples state-of-the-art piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer sensors to a neuromorphic resistive memories-based computational map. We present measurement results from the fabricated system comprising resistive memories-based coincidence detectors, delay line circuits, and a full-custom ultrasound sensor. We use these experimental results to calibrate our system-level simulations. These simulations are then used to estimate the angular resolution and energy efficiency of the object localization model. The results reveal the potential of our approach, evaluated in orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency than a microcontroller performing the same task."/>

Alumina OSL crystals are used because of their low Z, low fading and optical transparency, which improves the sensitivity. An optoelectronic portable dosemeter has been designed and tested that shows a dose detection of 50 $\mu$Gy with a 20 metre-long fibre. Following irradiation, all trapped electrons are released under light stimulation while the OSL is integrated to provide dose-equivalent measurements. A compensation technique is designed with the help of the MCNP4b code, so that both angular and photon energy characteristics comply with international standards (CEI 61066) for photon dose equivalent H$_p$(10). Two sensors are described that allow measurements over a wide solid angle (95% of 4$\pi$Sr), for photon energies ranging from 15 keV to 3 MeV."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="This paper presents a baseline-free quantitative method for the imaging of corrosion flaws present in thin plates with under-sampled data. This method is based on the Hybrid Algorithm for Robust Breast Ultrasound Tomography (HARBUT) which is itself inherently baseline-free. However, in order to ensure that the incident field component becomes negligible in the reconstruction, a calibration step is necessary. Indeed, it is essential to rescale the data with respect to the acoustic model whether it be simulation data or experimental data. This calibration is usually performed by manually choosing a ray for which the domain of propagation is assumed sound. This can be problematic because this method is not automatic. Moreover, if the chosen ray happens to pass through a flaw, the resulting image will be of poor quality. This paper proposes an autocalibration method for the rescaling step. The field of application is Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of critical structures with heavy constraints on both sensor intrusiveness and diagnostic reliability. In order to limit intrusiveness, a sub-sampled array of embedded guided waves sensors within the structure is used. Extensions to HARBUT are introduced to compensate for the aliasing caused by the undersampling. The benefits of these extensions are then assessed with numerical simulations and experimental datasets measured by a PZT network."/>

The idea is to inject a broadband test signal in the network under test and analyse the signal reflected by each impedance discontinuity. However, the presence of native signals on live wires may impact the diagnosis due to interference and EMC or limited bandwidth constraints. Our proposed 'Orthogonal Multi-Tone Time Domain Reflectometry'(OMTDR) method, based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technique, seems to be a suitable candidate for on-line diagnosis as it achieves high data rate transmission, interference robustness, bandwidth efficiency and complete spectrum control. Moreover, it allows communication among diagnosis sensors to accurately locate faults position in multi-branch wiring networks which require more than one diagnosis sensor."/>

This solution improves the localization by combining visual and depth data in a local bundle adjustment. Then, it presents an extension of this RGBD-SLAM that takes advantage of a partial knowledge of the scene. This solution allows using a prior knowledge of the 3D model of the environment when this latter is available which drastically improves the localization accuracy. The proposed solutions called RGBD-SLAM and Constrained RGBD-SLAM are evaluated on several public benchmark datasets and on real scenes acquired by a Kinect sensor. The system works in real time on a standard central processing units and it can be useful for certain applications, such as localization of lightweight robots, UAVs, and VR helmet."/>

In particular, it focuses on handling transmission errors due either to unreliable communications or active attacks. The main objective is to preserve the perceived quality of images, received at the destination node, whilst preserving the net-work resources, mainly communications. To this end, a new scheme, composed on two components, is proposed to defeat against communication errors. The first component consists in a new communication protocol, inspired from the ARQ protocol, at the data-link layer, in order to reduce the num-ber of frames re-transmissions. Combined with the second component which is a novel filtering mechanism to visually correct the received corrupted data at the destination node. Obtained results have validated the powerful strength of the proposed solution to defeat against various types of errors and to enhance the visual quality of images whilst ensuring content reduction and data confidentiality."/>

The main advantage of the proposed system is that sensors can be easily changed for another application or for cleaning since the developed gas cell presents removable electrical connections. We report the successful application of our electronic nose approach to detect 12 volatile organic compounds.

Third, the scheme offers the certificateless feature, so certificates are not needed to verify the user's public keys.

          <attvalue for="7" value="Dynamic measurements of shock and detonation velocities are performed using long chirped fiber Bragg gratings (CFBGs). Such thin probes, with a diameter of typically 125 µm or even 80 µm can be directly inserted into high-explosive (HE) samples or simply glued laterally. During the detonation, the width of the optical spectrum is continuously reduced by the propagation of the wave-front, which physically shortens the CFBG. The light power reflected back shows a ramp-down type signal, from which the wave-front position is obtained as a function of time, thus yielding a detonation velocity profile. A calibration procedure was developed, with the support of optical simulations, to cancel out the optical spectrum distortions from the different optical components and to determine the wavelength-position transfer function of the CFBG. The fitted slopes of the X-T diagram give steady detonation velocity values which are in very good agreement with the classical measurements obtained from discrete electrical shorting pins (ESP). The main parameters influencing the uncertainties on the steady detonation velocity value measured by CFBG are discussed. To conclude, different HE experimental configurations tested at CEA (Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives) are presented: bare cylindrical sticks, wedges for shock-to-detonation transitions (SDT), spheres, a cast-cured stick around a CFBG, and a detonation wave-front profile configuration."/>

However, when the fast neutron fluence reaches 10 18 -10 19 n/cm 2 , the radiation-induced changes in the material density and refractive index may drastically bias the measurements. This paper evaluates the radiation effect on the FBG performances by comparing their properties before and after their exposure to fast neutron fluences exceeding 1019 n/cm2 (E 1 MeV). We studied the responses of FBGs manufactured by three different laboratories in the same singlemode optical fiber but using different inscription conditions. The Bragg wavelength and the reflectivity were measured before and after irradiation thanks to a dedicated mounting. For nearly all FBGs, the Bragg peak remains visible after the irradiation while the radiation-induced Bragg wavelength shifts (RI-BWSs) vary from a few picometers (equivalent temperature error &amp;lt;;1 °C) to nearly 1 nm (~100 °C error) depending of the FBG inscription conditions. Such high RI-BWSs can be explained by the huge refractive-index variation and compaction observed for bare fiber samples through other experimental techniques. Our results show that by using specific hardening techniques, the FBGbased temperature measurements in a nuclear research reactor experiment may become feasible."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Energy dispersive photon spectrometry is a common analysis technique to quantify radionuclides present in a sample, the analysis is based on the knowledge of the photon emission intensities specific to each radionuclide. Among them, actinides have in general intense emission of L X-rays during the decay. However, their emission intensities are not well known and not detailed in the nuclear and atomic data tables due to the complexity of their spectra that cannot be resolved by conventional semiconductor spectrometers. Using a dedicated high energy resolution cryogenic detector, based on metallic magnetic calorimeter sensor technology, the L X-ray spectra of the decays of &lt;sup loc=&quot;post&quot;>238&lt;/sup>Pu(α) → &lt;sup loc=&quot;post&quot;>234&lt;/sup>U, &lt;sup loc=&quot;post&quot;>244&lt;/sup>Cm(α) → &lt;sup loc=&quot;post&quot;>240&lt;/sup>Pu, &lt;sup loc=&quot;post&quot;>237&lt;/sup>Np(α) → &lt;sup loc=&quot;post&quot;>233&lt;/sup>Pa and &lt;sup loc=&quot;post&quot;>233&lt;/sup>Pa(β&lt;sup loc=&quot;post&quot;>−&lt;/sup>) → &lt;sup loc=&quot;post&quot;>233&lt;/sup>U were measured with an energy resolution between 23 eV and 43 eV (full width at half maximum) given access to an unprecedented level of detail. Moreover, the detector was conceived to provide a quasi-constant efficiency in the energy range of the L X-rays, minimizing the uncertainty for relative L X-ray emission intensities. Prior to the measurements, the full energy peak efficiency was carefully characterized, which enabled the determination of absolute emission intensities, with an uncertainty of the order of 1%. Some corrections had to be introduced using Monte Carlo simulations, in particular to take into account the surface activity inhomogeneities of the sources. Total and group L X-ray emission intensities are compared with the available data and with the recommended values. In addition, nearly 30 individual L X-ray intensities are presented.

          <attvalue for="7" value="Fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) are one of the most used optical fiber sensors and they have recently drawn the attention of several research groups for their potential applications in harsh radiation environments. Up to now, their performances have been mainly evaluated under ionizing radiations, such as X-rays or γ -rays. We compare here the effects of different irradiation types, including X-rays, protons, and electrons, on type I FBGs written by UV laser exposure in Ge-, P/Ce-, and B/Ge-doped single-mode optical fibers. Different irradiation conditions were used according to the sources; 6-MeV electron irradiations were performed at a dose rate of 120 Gy(Si$O_{2}$ )/s up to an accumulated dose of 500 kGy; whereas for the 63-MeV protons, the estimated equivalent dose rate was of 0.75 Gy(Si$O_{2}$)/s up to a total dose of 7 kGy. In order to compare their effects with those induced by X-rays, two irradiations with 45-keV photons were performed with different dose rates [0.75 and 60 Gy/s (Si$O_{2}$ )] up to a total dose of 10 and 500 kGy, respectively. We demonstrated that X-rays and protons induce comparable effects at doses of about 10 kGy, whereas the behavior under electron beam appears to be strongly dependent on the fiber composition. For example, the grating in the B/Ge co-doped fiber is the most sensitive to electrons and the most resistant to X-rays; whereas the FBG inscribed in d in the $H_{2}$-loaded P/Ce co-doped fiber has exactly the opposite behavior."/>

Time synchronization protocols are not outlined with security support. As a consequence, a new generation of attacks arose, explicitly targeting the corresponding protocols. Recent research studies [1, 2, 3] prove that synchronization attacks are severe and practical. Without detection mechanisms, synchronization attacks bypass security defenses. A methodology for the detection of synchronization attacks based on characteristics of the synchronization protocol is proposed in this paper. Thus, we propose a novel method based on machine learning algorithms for detecting IIoT synchronization attacks. Applying such strategies for cyber-security in IIoT requires the availability of substantial synchronization IIoT attack data. In our research, the real-life equivalent simulations using the open source OpenWSN simulator has been utilized for generation of high fidelity attack area, within the 6TiSCH industrial network. We believe that the IIoT attack dataset generated in this work can be used for further research and for detecting high layer attacks too. Experimentation was carried out using six learning algorithms to detect the attack and classify them from legitimate behavior."/>

In a first step, a series of FBGs is irradiated in the EOLE critical facility with the aim to select the most appropriate. Online temperature measurements are performed during a set of irradiations that should allow reaching a fast neutron fluence of nearly 5·1014 n.cm-2 and a total gamma dose lower than 4 kGy. The results obtained, especially the Bragg wavelength shifts during the irradiation campaign, are discussed in this paper and compared to data from standard PT100 temperature sensors to highlight possible radiation effects on sensor performances. Work to be conducted during the second step of the project, aiming to a feasibility demonstration using a MASURCA assembly, is also presented."/>

To ensure the parts quality, monitoring of the manufacturing process by an instrument operating continuously during the manufacturing process should be carried out. The existing industrial solutions are limited in the sense that they are restricted to the detection of anomalies within machine state parameters or in the surface layers of the part under construction. Eddy current testing is a promising non-destructive testing method that could be applied for the layer-by-layer inspection of fused material during part fabrication. This inspection enables to follow the defects evaluation not only on the surface of the last fused layer but at the scale of the several fused layers. An eddy current sensor has been developed and adapted to perform measurements in a L-PBF machine during the manufacturing phase (in-situ). The performance and potential of the technique in terms of robust integration in the machine and defects evaluation have been studied. The obtained results allowed to evaluate the detection limits according to the width and the height of the defects during the manufacturing of the part. The influence of the powder presence around the fused area has also been studied."/>

The ASIC integrates the whole processing chain, i.e. the analog cells, in particular ADC/DAC, and the digital processing elements based on a custom processing unit (DSP-like) that analyzes in real time the reflected signal. An integrated oversampling system increases the ADC performance more than 20 times, enhancing the location accuracy down to 3 cm.

In this work, a nonconventional manufacturing process, the molten core method, is employed to fabricate and study sapphire (Al$_2$O$_3$) and YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) derived all-glass silicate optical fibers in which a femtosecond (fs) laser is used to imprint oriented nanostructures inside the fiber cores. Both writing kinetics and thermal stability of the laser-modified regions are investigated over a wide temperature range (20–1200 °C). The laser-imprinted modifications in these high alumina-content fibers exhibit improved thermal stability with respect to commercial pure silica and GeO$_2$-doped silica analogs. Furthermore, optical devices in the form of Rayleigh backscattering and fiber Bragg grating sensors are fabricated to demonstrate the high-temperature sensitivity and stability of these nonconventional fibers. This functionalization of aluminosilicate fibers by fs-laser direct writing opens the door to a new generation of optical devices suitable for high-temperature operation."/>

It is composed by infrared thermography, thermal measurement with thermocouples and fibre Bragg grating embedded few mm below the surface and flush mounted Langmuir probes. A large database including different magnetic equilibrium and input power is investigated to compare the heat load pattern (location, amplitude of the peak and heat flux decay length) on the inner and outer strike point regions: from the first ohmic diverted plasma (obtained during the second experimental campaign C2 in 2018) up to the high power (8 MW total injected) and high energy (up to 90 MJ injected energy in lower single null configuration) experiments performed in the last experimental campaign (C4 in 2019). Concerning the peak location, a good agreement (&lt;1 cm) is obtained between thermal inversions and flush-mounted LP measurements. The peak heat flux from the whole set of diagnostics is in good agreement and mainly in the ±20% range, while the heat flux decay length reported on the target shows significant discrepancy between diagnostics and location in the machine (±40% range). Despite such discrepancy, heat flux decay length at target is found to scale mainly with the magnetic flux expansion through the variation of the X-point height, as expected. The improved plasma performances achieved during C4 enabled to reach significant heat load in the divertor, up to 6 MW m$^2$ with 4 MW of additional heating power showing the capability to reach the ITER relevant heat load (10 MW/m$^2$ steady state) with about 7 MW of additional power in L-mode discharge. The heat load distribution is clearly asymmetric with a 3/4 and 1/4 distribution on the outer and inner strike point region respectively for the parallel heat flux."/>

The major novelty is to inject a signal carrying additional information about the fault position as a test signal using Orthogonal Multi-Tone Time Domain Reflectometry (OMTDR) method. While the reflected signal permits to determine the fault position at time t, the transmitted one sends the fault position at time (i-1) to the master sensor. Finally, the latter takes the location decision based on the information gathered from its slaves. This removing location ambiguities in branched networks. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) is used to avoid noise interference."/>

Inspired by the technique used in single quartz crystal oscillator, the method is extended to the MIMO case and is presented as an alternative solution to control multiple resonances of a force sensor. Three frequencies of one single active plate, on which several piezoelectric patches are bonded, are simultaneously excited. The method uses spatial modal decoupling technique implemented with analogue electronics thanks to a smart arrangement of the piezoelectric patches. This allows the full MIMO system to be transformed into three independent SISO subsystems. Then, for each of them, a controller is tuned to reinforce self-oscillation of the force sensor system to several resonant working points in a closed-loop configuration. Finally, experimental verification shows that the method can be successfully used for the control of a new type of resonant force sensors."/>

The photon counting detector Timepix1 is hereby used. The 3 mm CdTe sensor shows increase in count rate up to a factor of 1.25 compared to a 2 mm CdTe sensor, 1.84 compared to a 1 mm CdTe sensor and up to 2.71 compared to a 0.45 mm CdTe sensor in the case of 137Cs. In the second part, the 3 mm CdTe sensor was implemented in a commercially available gamma camera, the iPIX. The system was integrated in the bomb disposal robot and tested in different scenarios. The integrated 3 mm CdTe detector measured 21.5 counts per second emitting from a 60Co source with an activity of 2.8 ± 0.07 Gbq in 20 meters distance in an open environment. The acquisition time was 116 seconds. The angular resolution was sufficient for the user to localize the radioactive isotope inside the test structure."/>

By converting and processing the relevant information in the spiking domain, the energy consumption can be reduced by several orders of magnitude. We propose the first end-to-end ultra-low power Gesture Recognition (GR) system comprising an array of emitting and receiving piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (pMUT), driving/sensing electronics, a novel spike-based beamforming strategy to extract the distance and angle information from incoming echoes without conventional ADCs and a Spiking Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN) for the GR.

          <attvalue for="7" value="The Timepix3 hybrid-pixel readout chip consists of a matrix made of 256 × 256 square-shaped pixels with a 55-μm pitch, which can be hybridized to several semiconductors, such as silicon (Si) or cadmium telluride (CdTe) with thicknesses up to 5 mm. Working as an event-based readout chip, it simultaneously records the time-over-threshold (ToT) in each pixel, measuring the deposited energy, as well as the time-of-arrival (ToA), with a time resolution of 1.5 ns. In this article, we present the energy calibration of two Timepix3 chips: the first one was bump-bonded with a 300-μm-thick silicon sensor and the second one with a 1-mm-thick CdTe sensor. Both detectors were calibrated with per pixel calibration, using the monochromatic SOurce of Low-Energy X-rays [SOLEX from Henri Becquerel National Laboratory (LNHB) at CEA Saclay] and a set of calibration-grade sealed radioactive sources. Evaluations were carried out over the energy range 6-122 keV for Timepix3 Si and 20 keV- 1.332 MeV for Timepix3 CdTe. Based on this experimental procedure, an energy resolution of 2.6 keV (3.4%) at 59.5 keV was observed for Timepix3 Si. For Timepix3 CdTe, this parameter was 5.6 keV (9.4%) at 59.5 keV, 27.24 keV (4.1%) at 661.7 keV, and 47.4 keV (3.5%) at 1.332 MeV. It is the first time that CdTe bump-bonded Timepix3 spectral performances were evaluated for gamma rays above 1 MeV. The reconstruction of the full-energy peak for such high energies is possible due to the ToA information, which allows the identification of all interactions caused by a given gamma ray within the detector."/>

In this configuration, only the contact position and the force components are estimated. The tests have proven that this sensor satisfies most of the characteristics needed to achieve robotic dexterous manipulation."/>

OMTDR is a suitable candidate for on-line diagnosis as it permits interference avoidance by bandwidth control. Thanks to OMTDR's communication capability, network analysis as well as sensors intelligence can be easily distributed without any impact on network traffic. Complex network can be analyzed and fault location ambiguity can be solved thanks to distributed analysis. This enables to aggregate diagnosis information from several sensors and make a high level decision. Even for a simple network, OMTDR obtains a better fault location accuracy by combining different location data. In this paper, we analyze the benefit of integrating OMTDR into the harness. The demonstrator embeds both real time distributed wire diagnosis and sensor communication in 2 standard aerospace connectors. Thanks to this intelligence and capability added into commercial connectors, we call this innovative proposed solution: SmartCo for Smart-Connector. Hardware, software and demonstrator interface are presented in details."/>

In this context, micro-cantilever sensor is one of the most promising micromechanical sensor. In this paper a grafting method, compatible with MEMS technology, was used for grafting porcine OBPs on polycrystalline diamond cantilevers. These sensors have been tested, for the first time, in combination with an autonomous dedicated electronic system developed to automatically detect sensors response signals.

A dedicated process involving PMMA fibers, casted altogether forming hexagonal bundle, is demonstrated. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) signals are recorded on-line after irradiation and absorbed doses are compared to planned dose distribution. Real-time dose measurements may also be performed by recording the RadioLuminescence (RL), spontaneously emitted by the crystals during irradiation. In this case, a correction method is implemented to correct for stem effect influence (Cerenkov and scintillation generated within the fibers). For BT, the dual-fiber subtraction method is used (using a reference fiber) whereas the time discrimination method is used for IMRT. The experimental dose distribution leads to an underestimation of the source-sensor distance presumably due to energy dependence of the alumina crystal at low photon energy. At the time being, Monte-Carlo modeling of the FODC is performed with the aim to estimate this energy dependence and finally correct for it. Finally, metrological and preclinical validations are still running at Centre Léon Bérard (Lyon, France) in the purpose of checking the compliance of the FODC prototypes with treatment specifications and medical constraints."/>

However, the properties of neuromorphic systems could be particularly interesting for learning from continuous sensor data in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a deep spiking convolutional neural network of integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons which performs unsupervised online deep learning with spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) from a stream of asynchronous and continuous event-based data. In contrast to previous approaches to unsupervised deep learning with spikes, where layers were trained successively, we introduce a mechanism to train all layers of the network simultaneously. This allows approximate online inference already during the learning process and makes our architecture suitable for online learning and inference. We show that it is possible to train the network without providing implicit information about the database, such as the number of classes and the duration of stimuli presentation. By designing an STDP learning rule which depends only on relative spike timings, we make our network fully event-driven and able to operate without defining an absolute timescale of its dynamics. Our architecture requires only a small number of generic mechanisms and therefore enforces few constraints on a possible neuromorphic hardware implementation. These characteristics make our network one of the few neuromorphic architecture which could directly learn features and perform inference from an event-based vision sensor."/>

Based on a low-cost EMG sensor bracelet placed around the arm (Myo armband, Thalmics Lab, Ontario), a subject-specific mapping procedure is implemented to discriminate motion intentions during lifting tasks with a 1-DoF upper-limb exoskeleton. The processing is divided into two main parts: (i) direction estimation with an artificial neural network, and (ii) a model-based intensity prediction. The mapping procedure has been tested on 7 healthy participants with a precision of 96.9 $\pm$ 3.1% for the classification and a RMS Error of 3.8 $\pm$ 0.8$N$ at the end effector. This study opens up the way for fast-deployment applications involving exoskeletons or cobots."/>

The dose-mean lineal energy ($\overline{y}_D$) values were computed from experimental data and compared to silicon on insulator (SOI) microdosimeter literature results. In addition, the measured dose profile, pulse height spectra and $\overline{y}_D$ values were benchmarked with a numerical simulation using TOPAS and Geant4 toolkits.

          <attvalue for="7" value="Alpha particles detection in liquid media remains challenging since alpha particles are self-absorbed by a few micrometers of liquid. Conventional techniques consist of electrodepositing alpha emitter species on a surface and counting alpha particles using e.g. a silicon device. We have presented a novel approach associating a boron doped nanocrystalline diamond film to a silicon PIN diode alpha sensor. In our devices, actinides collection is performed using a novel method based on electroprecipitation that can be carried out in the solution itself via the use of a doped diamond electrode. The device enables to directly probe both alpha activity as well as energy in liquid solutions. This work demonstrated that the detection of alpha particles is made feasible directly in liquid media. Here we present recent progress addressing the optimization of the actinides electroprecipitation step on the diamond/silicon sensor. The approach is based on the fine tuning of the pH of the electrolyte, the nature of the supporting electrolytes Na2SO4 and NaNO3, the geometry of the electrochemical cell, the current density value, the precipitation duration and the sensor area. The efficiency of the deposition was significantly improved with efficiency values reaching for example up to 81.5 % for the electroprecipitation of 5.96 Bq of 241Am on the diamond/silicon sensor. The diamond/silicon sensor can be reused after measurement using fast decontamination at high yields ≥ 99 %: e.g. the deposited 241Am electroprecipitated layer can be rapidly removed by applying an anodic current (+ 2 mA/cm2 for 10 minutes) to the electrode in aqueous solution. The diamond/silicon sensor shows also very high spectroscopic stability after 30 cycles of sensing with precipitation/decontamination loops. This study demonstrated that alpha particles spectroscopy measurements could be practically performed, for the first time, in media composed of aqueous solutions after electrochemical deposition process, with detections limits reaching 0.24 Bq/L. We believe this can be of very high interest for alpha spectroscopy in liquids for trace detection."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Measuring the temperature in plasma-facing components (PFCs) provides information both on plasma parameters in the divertor region and on the thermal stress experienced by PFCs. Fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) are interesting candidates for this application because they are immune to electromagnetic interferences and their ability to be multiplexed allows an extended spatial coverage. Four fibers, each of them including eleven regenerated Bragg gratings, have been embedded in tungsten-coated graphite components and operated up to their signal-collapsing limit at 800°C. Extending the measurement range towards higher temperatures increases the sensitivity to plasma parameters and allows withstanding higher energy experiments. To overcome thermal limitations, the system is upgraded using femtosecond laser inscribed fibers. In addition to their outstanding thermal stability, femtosecond FBGs benefit from higher signal-to-noise ratios than regenerated FBGs. The paper addresses femtosecond FBGs design and issues relative to their integration inside the actively cooled ITER-like PFCs of the WEST tokamak. Gratings period and length is designed to increase the number of measurement spots to fourteen gratings per fiber, regularly distributed over 17cm, while ensuring robust detection even with strong thermal gradients (no overlapping or deformation of Bragg peaks). The system operates up to 1200°C with gradients reaching 200°C/mm perpendicularly and 40°C/mm in parallel to the fiber. FBGs are inserted in actively cooled ITER-like PFCs through a 2.5mm deep lateral groove localized at 5mm beneath the top of bulk tungsten mono-blocks. A PFC mock-up machined with a groove has been tested under HHF facility to assess the effect of the groove on mono-blocks thermal behavior. The test demonstrates that machined mono-blocks behave as expected from simulation and can withstand 20 MW/m 2 heat flux (i.e. 1200°C in the fiber) with 20% overheating as compared to intact mono-blocks."/>

Therefore, they are suitable for accurate measurements of X-ray or gamma-ray transition energies. However, the energy response of LTDs is non-linear. Therefore, it is required to correct the non-linearity to provide precise and accurate measurement. In this work, we present the study of the non-linearity of an LTD based on metallic magnetic sensors having an energy resolution below around 50 eV up to energies of 200 keV. The non-linearity was measured using a mix of radionuclides, 241Am, 152Eu, 210Pb, 129I and 139Ce, emitting X-rays and gamma-rays below 200 keV. The pulse energies and the energy spectra were obtained from different types of signal processing to evaluate their impact on the non-linearity. In addition, pulses were recorded with different preamplifier gains to identify possible non-linearity arising from the electronics and the DAQ. Finally the measured non-linearities were compared with the calculated non-linearity form the thermodynamic quantities of the MMC."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="The detection and quantification of defects in pipes by non-destructive testing techniques plays a crucial role in several industries (petrochemical and nuclear in particular). Once a defect is detected, assessing its severity enables to schedule maintenance appropriately, hence reducing maintenance cost and rupture or leakage risks. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is an approach that consists in instrumenting a structure with permanent sensors to monitor its health status throughout its life. Guided elastic waves are particularly suitable for SHM applications on thin structures (such as pipes) thanks to their ability to propagate over long distances and their high sensitivity. An SHM approach called &quot;passive guided waves tomography&quot; has emerged in recent years to detect and quantify corrosion in pipes (or plate-like structures). This technology is based on the combination of guided elastic wave tomography algorithms and a passive method such as the so-called ambient noise cross-correlation. It allows to obtain absolute and precise maps of the thickness of an area surrounded by a distribution of sensors without emitting waves, simply by analyzing the elastic noise that exists naturally in the pipe (due to vibrations, fluid-structure interactions with a moving fluid, etc.). In this paper passive guided waves tomography is tested in representative conditions thanks to an erosion loop that circulates air and sand. By impacting the tube wall, sand grains erode the structure, creating thickness losses that we monitor with passive tomography."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="We measured the radiation tolerance of commercially available diamonds grown by the Chemical Vapor Deposition process by measuring the charge created by a 120 GeV hadron beam in a 50 μm pitch strip detector fabricated on each diamond sample before and after irradiation. We irradiated one group of samples with 70 MeV protons, a second group of samples with fast reactor neutrons (defined as energy greater than 0.1 MeV), and a third group of samples with 200 MeV pions, in steps, to (8.8±0.9) × 1015 protons/cm2, (1.43±0.14) × 1016 neutrons/cm2, and (6.5±1.4) × 1014 pions/cm2, respectively. By observing the charge induced due to the separation of electron–hole pairs created by the passage of the hadron beam through each sample, on an event-by-event basis, as a function of irradiation fluence, we conclude all datasets can be described by a first-order damage equation and independently calculate the damage constant for 70 MeV protons, fast reactor neutrons, and 200 MeV pions. We find the damage constant for diamond irradiated with 70 MeV protons to be 1.62±0.07(stat)±0.16(syst)× 10−18 cm2/(pμm), the damage constant for diamond irradiated with fast reactor neutrons to be 2.65±0.13(stat)±0.18(syst)× 10−18 cm2/(nμm), and the damage constant for diamond irradiated with 200 MeV pions to be 2.0±0.2(stat)±0.5(syst)× 10−18 cm2/(πμm). The damage constants from this measurement were analyzed together with our previously published 24 GeV proton irradiation and 800 MeV proton irradiation damage constant data to derive the first comprehensive set of relative damage constants for Chemical Vapor Deposition diamond. We find 70 MeV protons are 2.60 ± 0.29 times more damaging than 24 GeV protons, fast reactor neutrons are 4.3 ± 0.4 times more damaging than 24 GeV protons, and 200 MeV pions are 3.2 ± 0.8 more damaging than 24 GeV protons. We also observe the measured data can be described by a universal damage curve for all proton, neutron, and pion irradiations we performed of Chemical Vapor Deposition diamond. Finally, we confirm the spatial uniformity of the collected charge increases with fluence for polycrystalline Chemical Vapor Deposition diamond, and this effect can also be described by a universal curve"/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="High pressure shock profiles are monitored using a long Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG). Such thin probe, with a diameter of typically 150 µm, can be inserted directly into targets for shock plate experiments. The shocked FBG's portion is stressed under compression, which increases its optical group index and shortens its grating period. Placed along the 2D symmetrical axis of the cylindrical target, the second effect is stronger and the reflected spectrum shifts towards the shorter wavelengths. The dynamic evolution of FBG spectra is recorded with a customized Arrayed Waveguide Grating (AWG) spectrometer covering the C+L band. The AWG provides 40 channels of 200-GHz spacing with a special flat-top design. The output channels are fiber-connected to photoreceivers (bandwidth: DC - 400 MHz or 10 kHz - 2 GHz). The experimental setup was a symmetric impact, completed in a 110-mm diameter single-stage gas gun with Aluminum (6061T6) impactors and targets. The FBG's central wavelength was 1605 nm to cover the pressure range of 0 - 8 GPa. The FBG was 50-mm long as well as the target's thickness. The 20-mm thick impactor maintains a shock within the target over a distance of 30 mm. For the impact at 522 m/s, the sustained pressure of 3.6 GPa, which resulted in a Bragg shift of (26.2 +/- 1.5) nm, is measured and retrieved with respectively thin-film gauges and the hydrodynamic code Ouranos. The shock sensitivity of the FBG is about 7 nm/GPa, but it decreases with the pressure level. The overall spectra evolution is in good agreement with the numerical simulations."/>

For time-causality reasons, and for the sake of hardware complexity, it has long been assumed that measuring only the real part of signals within a diagnosis system should be enough for fault detection. However, in certain circumstances, electrical singularities remains undetected. This paper recalls that there is more to discover in the imaginary part of the reflected signal than just an argument to estimate the phase delay. The presented method provides several advantages over state-of-the-art techniques and is particularly well suited for implementations in distributed sensor networks. Accordingly, our measurements were performed through the use of an FPGA-based embedded platform with external frequency-modulation circuits and our estimations were proven quite accurate and realistic for multi-carrier signals, allowing the detection of previously undiscovered defects."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="To monitor radioactivity passing through a pipe or in a given container such as a train or a truck, radiation detection systems are commonly employed. These detectors could be used in a network set along the source track to increase the overall detection efficiency. However detection methods are based on counting statistics analysis. The method usually implemented consists in trigging an alarm when an individual signal rises over a threshold initially estimated in regards to the natural background signal. The detection efficiency is then proportional to the number of detectors in use, due to the fact that each sensor is taken as a standalone sensor. A new approach is presented in this paper taking into account the temporal periodicity of the signals taken by all distributed sensors as a whole. This detection method is not based only on counting statistics but also on the temporal series analysis aspect. Therefore, a specific algorithm is then developed in our lab for this kind of applications and shows a significant improvement, especially in terms of detection efficiency and false alarms reduction. We also plan on extracting information from the source vector. This paper presents the theoretical approach and some preliminary results obtain in our laboratory."/>

Within the framework of the refurbishment of the MASURCA facility, the development of a new temperature measurement system based on the optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) technology is under consideration. In a first step, a series of FBGs is irradiated in the EOLE critical facility with the aim to select the most appropriate. Online temperature measurements are performed during a set of irradiations that should allow reaching a fast neutron fluence nearly 5-1014 n.cm-2 and a total gamma dose less than 4 kGy. The results obtained, especially the Bragg wavelength shifts during the irradiation campaign, are discussed in this paper and compared to data from standard PT100 temperature sensors to highlight possible radiation effects on sensor performances. Work to be conducted during the second step of the project, aiming to a feasibility demonstration using a MASURCA assembly, is also presented."/>

We show that these three methods are equivalent, could be combined, and that there is a competition between noise suppression and sensitivity reduction, which results in an optimum total pinning field for which the detection limit of the sensor is improved up to a factor of 10.

Huge performance improvements in terms of precision and sensitivity can be achieved with higher frequencies and signal modulation, hence revealing phase and amplitude response of the potential impedance discontinuities on the tested channel to better classify the defects. However, as for telecommunications, frequency translation requires a special care in signal processing and integrity, the relative complexity of which has discouraged its implementation in wire diagnosis systems for now. Crossing the domains with an ingenious phase-offset correction mechanism, we show that defects can be accurately detected and correctly analyzed with our system relying on quadrature modulation. The presented method provides several advantages over state-of-the-art techniques and is particularly well suited for implementations in distributed sensor networks. Accordingly, our measurements were performed using an FPGA-based embedded platform and discrete high-frequency components."/>

The emerging of sensor networks and connected objects has created the need for embedded and non invasive fault diagnosis solutions. Actual systems rely on multi-carrier reflectometry to locate upcoming defects on wires, though their precision stays within the physical limits of their components, especially the sampling frequency of their analog parts. We propose a new approach combining multi-carrier reflectometry and phase analysis to overcome this limit, in order to improve the precision of the localization of the defects on electrical wires. Based on an FPGA implementation, our novel method and the resulting system has proven a five-times better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods on the same platform."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="The preparation of various plastic scintillators with embedded carbazole moieties is reported. As a result of their versatility and advantageous luminescence properties, this system is a candidate of choice for such applications. Through careful system design, the carbazole in the system can have a variety of functions, for example as the polymer matrix, as the primary fluorophore or as the secondary fluorophore. For systems in which carbazole is embedded in the polymer matrix, poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) and poly(styrene-co-N-vinylcarbazole) were prepared by bulk radical polymerization. For application as a primary or secondary fluorophore, N-(2-ethylhexyl)carbazole (EHCz) is a particularly suitable molecule. When used at a low concentration it can act either as a primary fluorophore (when coupled with 1,4-bis(5-phenyloxazol-2-yl) (POPOP) or bis-(2-methylstyryl)benzene (bis-MSB) as the wavelength shifter), or as both primary and secondary fluorophore if the concentration inside the polymer matrix is high. The performance of EHCz was compared with the related molecule N-(ethyl)carbazole. Finally, another carbazole-containing molecule 2,4,5,6-tetrakis(carbazol-9-yl)-1,3-dicyanobenzene was loaded in a polymer matrix as the secondary fluorophore. Scintillation results show its efficiency to shift the scintillation response to wavelengths close to 500 nm. The preparation and primary photo-physical properties of each of these new plastic scintillators was reported, in addition to the scintillation properties of each. These results highlight the potential application of carbazole derivatives as fluorophores for nuclear detection"/>

Optical inspection is often imple-mented in the machines during the manufacturing process in order to monitor the possible gen-erated defects. However, to improve the understanding of the process and the quality of the manufactured parts, other non-destructive testing methods are studied. In this paper, the eddy current method is used for testing as this technique is adapted to detect surface and shallow de-fects in conductive materials. Using simulations with the CIVA Non Destructive Testing soft-ware package, several sensors and their parameters were tested in order to determine the most optimal ones: a separate transmitter/receiver sensor and an isotropic sensor were finally de-signed. The comparison of these sensors efficiency was made on the detection of notches and engraved letters based on simulation and experimental tests on parts fabricated by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) in order to determine the optimal sensor. The various tests showed that the isotropic sensor is the optimal one for the detection and characterization of defects."/>

The RD42 collaboration has continued to seek out additional diamond manufacturers and quantify the limits of the radiation tolerance of this material. The ATLAS experiment has recently installed, and is now commissioning a fully-fledged pixel tracking detector system based on diamond sensors.

          <attvalue for="7" value="Objective. ­ The main risk factor for the development of glaucoma, a retinal disease leading to blindness, is an increase in the intraocular pressure (IOP). Reducing this IOP can be obtained by eye drops but unfortunately the disease can still progress because IOP increases are painless, can fluctuate and, thus remain undetected during a visit to an ophthalmologist. The &quot;MATEO&quot; ANR project aims to develop sensors embedded in a contact lens for continuously IOP monitoring. Materials and methods. ­ Pressure sensors were produced by MEMS technology and tested with pig eyes obtained at a local slaughterhouse. Solution was injected by 50 L steps in the eye with a Hamilton syringe while IOP was monitored in parallel with a TonoVET system and an industrial pressure transducer inserted in the injection tubing system. Results. ­ Our first pressure sensor prototypes were generated and inserted in a lens compatible with eye application. A wireless system was developed to excite the sensor. At same time, it was recorded the data in components inserted into spectacles and a pocket recorder. In parallel, we showed that injecting a solution in the eye anterior chamber triggered an IOP increase smaller and more stable than injections in the posterior chamber. Finally, a direct correlation was observed between IOP measured on the corneal surface with the TonoVET and the pressure transducer placed close to eye injection point. Discussion. ­ Our results indicate that our in vitro model on pig eyes is adequate to test our new lens sensor. Finally, the pressure sensor was successfully inserted in contact lens opening the way for their in vitro and in vivo preclinical validation."/>

A system fusing INS and GNSS could thereby compute a position anywhere. Yet, taking advantage of each sensor requires to know which one is the most reliable in real-time. Therefore, a quantification of the sensors' reliabity is introduced in this paper. This approach aims at running both outdoors and indoors. Moreover, the complexity of algorithms is carefully studied here to fit the user mobility requirements. Experiments are conducted in reproducible situations and results show that taking reliabilities into account benefits the hybridization of INS and GNSS for positioning in both convenient and constrained environments."/>

Measurements of their resistivity at 300 K indicate a fluence discrepancy from the expected value and confirm the homogeneity of the doping throughout the volume.

A set of twenty thermocouples (TCs) and four optical fiber temperature sensing probes, each of them including eleven wavelengthmultiplexed fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) written with UV radiation, have been integrated and deployed in the WEST lower divertor. To avoid any thermal erasure occurring above 400°C, the gratings have been regenerated using a high temperature annealing process. The FBG probes are embedded in tungsten-coated graphite components with no active cooling. The diagnostic was working correctly from the first plasma breakdown achieved in WEST (in 2017) until the first dismantling of the lower divertor three years later (2020). Collected data are sorted by temperature range to investigate the ageing of both PFCs and diagnostics. Measurements obtained with FBGs and TCs are consistent, no long-term drift is reported during the overall period of use. The maximum temperature reported by FBGs in the divertor is 830 °C obtained with 90 MJ of cumulated plasma energy in one pulse. A short but reversible collapse of the Bragg peak (from 5 down to 2 dB) has been observed under high temperature due to the strong temperature gradients measured along the fiber (about 20°C/mm, for an FBG size of 3 mm). This feedback demonstrates that regenerated FBGs are suitable for long-term temperature monitoring in tokamak environment with high heat load, high temperature and gradient, strong magnetic field and vacuum constraint."/>

This paper presents the performances in terms of response time and high temperature sustaining assess with high heat flux tests performed in the HADES facility. The response time of the TC remains at the same level as before their installation in the divertor. However, the FBG have shown clear increase of their response time depending on the location due to a degradation of the thermal contact of the graphite adhesive and the FBG or component. Finally, one regenerated FBG has been exposed to high temperature, showing that absolute temperature measurement is found reliable up to 1100 °C with the start of some spectrum degradations.

It is only based on proprioceptive signals and does not rely on external force sensors. We primarily focus on the mechatronic design rationale of the robotic hand. A modular approach simplifies the complex hand assembly and permits to concentrate efforts on one basic unit which is replicated throughout the hand. An optimized mechanical design of this unit assures backdrivability through the whole mechanism, including actuators and transmission of movement to the joints. Based on this feature, external forces applied to the finger can be sensed at the motor level. Overall, this mechatronic design contributes to the improvement of manipulation skills of robotic hands, thanks to the combination of high performance mechanics, high sensitivity to external forces and torque control capability without using external force sensor. Experimental results confirm the validity of our design approach, which provides a highly integrated method for sensing the interacting force."/>

To improve the accuracy and the robustness of the localization, we propose to combine in a local bundle adjustment process, geometric information provided by a prior coarse 3D model of the scene (e.g. generated from the 2D plan of the building) with RGBD data.

For this purpose, the BOOSTER consortium, relying on the expertise of seven members, researches and develops new approaches to allow an effective and fast management of most kind of nuclear threats. BOOSTER System was designed to help first responders mitigating the crisis by providing the necessary information to quickly assess the radiological situation, to support triage staff in performing an efficient and fast categorization of the potentially affected victims, and to give medical staff crucial information for further treatment at medium or long term post-accident."/>

It integrates a Caliste-HD CdTe-hybrid detector designed for space X-ray astronomy coupled with a new system-on-chip based acquisition system (FPGA and ARM microprocessor) and thermo-electrical coolers for a use at room temperature. The complete gamma part of the camera fits in a volume of for a mass lower than 1 kg and a power consumption lower than 10 W. Localization and spectro-identification of radionuclides in a contaminated scene were demonstrated during several test campaigns. A new generation of system is under development taking into account feedback experience from in-situ measurements and integrating a new generation of sensor cost-optimized by industrial applications called Caliste-O. Caliste-O holds a 16x16 pixel detector of 14x14 mm2 and 2 mm thick with 8 full-custom front-end IDeF-X HD ASICs. Two prototypes were fabricated and tested. The paper will present the results of in-situ measurements with the first gamma camera, the spectroscopic performance of Caliste-O and the design of the second generation of gamma camera which aims for real time imaging and spectro-identification."/>

This article focuses on the selection and testing of single-mode optical fibers with limited radiation-induced attenuation (RIA). To simulate the normal operation period of the reactor, followed by a severe accident, several gamma and mixed (neutron-gamma) irradiations were performed, thanks to the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) Saclay facilities, POSÉÏDON irradiator and ISIS reactor, up to a gamma cumulative dose of about 2 MGy and fast neutrons fluence (E > 1 MeV) of 6 × 10 15 n/cm 2 . In comparison with the first gamma test on standalone fibers, a significant increase of the RIA at 1550 nm appeared during the second test on fibers encapsulated in sensing cables. Molecular hydrogen generated by the cable compound radiolysis induced an increase of the hydroxyl (OH) attenuation broad spectral peak centered at 1380 nm. The radiation-induced OH growth mechanism is confirmed by the comparison of the extended absorption spectral responses of the standalone and encapsulated fibers. A third gamma irradiation run permitted to measure the radiolytic hydrogen production yield of some compounds of a dedicated temperature cable sample. The efficiency of a carboncoating layer over the silica cladding, acting as a barrier against hydrogen diffusion into the optical fiber core, was successfully tested under gamma irradiation as well as in a final test under neutron irradiation."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Occupancy grid maps are widely used as an environment model that allows the fusion of different range sensor technologies in real-time for robotics applications. In an autonomous vehicle setting, occupancy grid maps are especially useful for their ability to accurately represent the position of surrounding obstacles while being robust to discrepancies between the fused sensors through the use of occupancy probabilities representing uncertainty. In this article, we propose to evaluate the applicability of real-time vehicle detection on occupancy grid maps. State of the art detectors in sensor-specific domains such as YOLOv2/YOLOv3 for images or PIXOR for LiDAR point clouds are modified to use occupancy grid maps as input and produce oriented bounding boxes enclosing vehicles as output. The five proposed detectors are trained on the Waymo Open automotive dataset and compared regarding the quality of their detections measured in terms of Average Precision (AP) and their real-time capabilities measured in Frames Per Second (FPS). Of the five detectors presented, one inspired from the PIXOR backbone reaches the highest AP0.7 of 0.82 and runs at 20 FPS. Comparatively, two other proposed detectors inspired from YOLOv2 achieve an almost as good, with a AP0.7 of 0.79 while running at 91 FPS. These results validate the feasibility of real-time vehicle detection on occupancy grids."/>

For the upcoming phase 2 of WEST, the lower divertor is now fully equipped with the ITER-like actively cooled bulk tungsten Plasma Facing Units (PFU), designed to withstand 10MW/m2 in steady state. This divertor is also equipped with an enlarged set of ThermoCouples (TCs x 16) and Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) probes (x5) with 14 measurement spots each to evaluate the heat loading during the experiments. This paper presents the new TC and FBG diagnostics as well as the associated inverse method used to estimate the surface heat flux from the embedded temperature measurements in the divertor. The performance of each diagnostic will be evaluated with synthetic measurements generated with realistic heat flux intensity and distribution. The results of a parametrical analysis shows that each diagnostic is able to estimate the spatial distribution of the expected heat fluxes in WEST"/>

To do so, the SmartCo injects the generated OMTDR signal at an extremity of the cable and then listens to the echoes created at each discontinuity of the cable characteristic impedance. Since soft defects result in faint reflected energy, they are hard to distinguish from the noise. Hence, the SmartCo uses an innovative approach based on advanced post-processing methods data fusion to eliminate false alarms and to determine the small soft fault position."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="This paper presents ABLE, an innovative exoskeleton for the upper limb currently under development at CEA-LIST Interactive Robotics Unit (Fig 1). Its distinctive high performance mechanical transmissions-screw and cable patented arrangement [9]-and its integrated architecture makes it the very first of its category. The first 4 axis model is described here but more complete models are already planned: a 7 axis model as well as portable versions. Its back-drivable, high efficiency, low inertia actuators provide a high capacity (around 40 N continuous effort at the hand) and allow hybrid force-position control without requiring any force sensor. Its first application is currently a research program in rehabilitation (BRAHMA project) and professional use is already in view. Assistance tasks for disabled persons (carrying a bottle) are also typical tasks to be performed by ABLE as well as intuitive telerobotics, haptic device for VR, and sport training, etc. Furthermore, its versatility and simple design allow industrial versions to become soon available. Fig 1. CEA-LIST 4 axis exoskeleton actuated by screw-and-cable actuators (SCS actuator) I. THE GENESIS OF ABLE-A SHORT STORY OF THE SCS ACTUATOR ABLE exoskeleton is directly related to electrical master-slave manipulator (EMSM) teleoperation technology in which our laboratory has played a historical role. Fig 2 shows a quick summary of well-known pioneering machines [8], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] illustrated with their mechanical solutions.

Landmarks in torque amplification for back-drivable electrical master-slave telemanipulator (EMSM) The first principle has been used by R. Goertz (ANL) in his E1-E4 and Model M. Motor torque is amplified using high-precision spur gears driving the joints either directly (translation joints) or, like the scheme shows, trough transmission cable (for remote rotation joints). The second is due to J. Vertut and is team (CEA) for the MA 23. Motor"/>

The measurement setup consists of an OSLD crystal connected onto the extremity of an optical fiber and a laser stimulation system, manufactured by the CEA/LIST, Saclay, France. The OSL sensor is remotely stimulated via an optical fiber using a diode-pumped solid-state laser. The OSL light is collected and guided back along the same fiber to a photomultiplier tube through appropriate optical filters. OSL signals are corrected for background noise and integrated to provide the absorbed doses thanks to calibration coefficients. The light stimulation also fully bleaches the crystal (reusable for the next measurement). Results obtained using this system are compared to usual gamma-heating measurement protocol using OSLD pellets. Both measurement processes were calibrated to ensure the comparison of absolute doses in gray at the same positions in the core. The presence of induced radioluminescence in the OSLD during the irradiation was also observed and could be used to monitor the gamma flux. The feasibility of remote measurements is achieved, whereas further developments could be conducted to improve this technique since the readout procedure still requires to withdraw the OSLD off the gamma flux (hence from the core) on account of the dose rate (around a few Gy·h$^{-1}$ ), and the readout time remains quite long for online applications. Several improvements are foreseen and will be tested in the forthcoming years."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Optical-fiber sensors based on fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) provide accurate, nonintrusive, and reliable remote measurements of temperature, strain, and pressure, and they are immune to electromagnetic interference. FBGs are extensively used in telecommunications, and their manufacture is now cost-effective. As sensors, FBGs find many industrial applications in composite structures used in the civil engineering, aeronautics, train transportation, space, and naval sectors. Tiny FBG sensors embedded in a composite material can provide in situ information about polymer curing (strain, temperature, refractive index) in an elegant and nonintrusive way. Great improvements in composite manufacturing processes such as resin transfer molding (RTM) and resin film infusion (RFI) have been obtained through the use of these sensors. They can also be used in monitoring the “health” of a composite structure and in impact detection to evaluate, for example, the airworthiness of aircraft. Finally, FBGs may be used in instrumentation as composite extensometers or strain rosettes, primarily in civil engineering applications."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="War against CBRN-E threats needs to continuously develop sensors with improved detection efficiency. More particularly, this topic concerns the NR controls for homeland security. A first analysis requires indeed a fast gamma spectrometry so as to detect potential special nuclear materials (SNM). To this aim, plastic scintillators could represent the best alternative for the production of large-scale, low-cost radiation portal monitors to be deployed on boarders, tolls, etc. Although they are known to be highly sensitive to gamma rays, due to their poor resolution, information relative to the nature of the SNM is tricky. Thus, only the Compton edge is obtained after interaction, and no information of the photoelectric peak is observed. This project concerns new developments on a possible pseudo-gamma spectrometry performed with plastic scintillators. This project is articulated on a combination of two developments: The design of new materials most suitable for recovering the photoelectric peak after gamma interaction with the scintillator. This work concerns mainly plastic scintillators loading with heavy elements, such as lead or bismuth. The analysis of the resulting signal with smart algorithms. This work is thus a pluridisciplinary work performed at CEA LIST and embeds 4 main disciplines: MCNPX simulations (simulated spectra), chemistry of materials (preparation of various plastic scintillators with different properties), instrumentation (lab experiments) and smart algorithms. Really impressive results were obtained with the unfolding of simulated spectra at various energies (from 241Am to 60Co) and an innovative approach was proposed to counter-balance the quenching effect of luminescence by heavy elements in plastic scintillators."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Dynamic measurements of detonation velocity profiles are performed using long Chirped Fiber Bragg Gratings (CFBGs). Such thin probes, with a diameter of typically 150 µm, are inserted directly into a high explosive sample or simply positioned laterally. During the detonation, the width of the reflected optical spectrum is continuously reduced by the propagation of the wave-front, which physically shortens the CFBG. The reflected optical intensity delivers a ramp down signal type, which is directly related to the detonation velocity profile. Experimental detonation velocity measurements were performed on the side of three different high explosives (TNT, B2238 and V401) in a bare cylindrical stick configuration (diameter: 2 inches, height: 10 inches). The detonation velocity range covered was 6800 to 9000 m/s. The extraction of the detonation velocity profiles requires a careful calibration of the system and of the CFBG used. A calibration procedure was developed, with the support of optical simulations, to cancel out the optical spectrum distortions from the different optical components and to determine the wavelength-position transfer function of the CFBG in a reproducible way. The 40-mm long CFBGs were positioned within the second half of the three high explosive cylinders. The excellent linearity of the computed position-time diagram confirms that the detonation was established for the three high explosives. The fitted slopes of the position-time diagram give detonation velocity values which are in very good agreement with the classical measurements obtained from discrete electrical shorting pins."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Fuel debris have a distinct neutron signature that can be detected to locate the said debris in a damaged nuclear power plant. Neutron measurement in a damaged PCV environment is however submitted to severe deployments constraints, including a high-dose-rate gamma background and limited available space. The study was therefore oriented towards small fission chambers (FC), with U-235-enriched active substrates. To investigate the expected performance of the FC in various irradiation conditions, a numerical model of the detector head was built. We describe the elaboration and experimental calibration of the numerical model and the Monte Carlo study of the fission rate inside U-235 coatings per generated neutron. The evaluation of a representative calibration coefficient then allowed us to carry out a multi-parameter performance study of a FC underwater, aiming at computing an explicit response function linking, on the one hand, the activity and spatial distribution of neutron emitters in a water container, with, one the other hand, the expected count rates measured by a fission chamber as a function of its radial and axial position inside the water volume. The FC underwater behavior was subsequently corroborated by a measurement campaign on a FC response, set at different positions inside a water drum, as a function of its axial and radial distance to a Cf-252 neutron source attached near the center of the container. We finally present an approach in which fuel debris localization is defined as an Inverse Problem, solvable with a Maximum-Likelihood Expectation Maximization (ML-EM) iterative algorithm. The projector matrix is built by capitalization on the results of the previously consolidated numerical studies. The ML-EM was tested on simulated data sets with a varying number of active voxels. Our first results indicate that, for a thermal neutron flux in the order of 10 n.cm−2.s−1 at the detector, originating voxels are identified with a spatial resolution in the radial plane in the order of 10 to 100 cm2."/>

The effectiveness of this approach to early detect and recognize explosive compounds in the air has been successfully demonstrated on an experimentally obtained dataset."/>

We show that, under optimal growth conditions, this strategy leads to a reduction in dislocation density by two orders of magnitude to reach an average value of 6 × 10$^5$ cm$^{−2}$ in the region where lateral growth occurred, which is equivalent to that typically measured for commercial type Ib single crystal diamonds."/>

A layer of B-NCD of several hundred nanometers thickness and boron concentration up to 1021 atoms/cm3 is grown on the SiOx passivation layer in an ellipsoidal plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) reactor at temperatures from 520-750°C, in hydrogen atmosphere. . The diamond electrode is dry chemically structured and aluminum electrodes are realized before mounting in a three-fold housing for measurements in aqueous solution.

          <attvalue for="7" value="Guided elastic waves emitted by a sensor and propagating to another one are often used as the physical way of detecting the defect in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems of plate-like structures. However, the implementation of SHM systems is restricted in many situations by the necessity to store or to harvest the electric energy necessary to emit the waves. A promising way to overcome this constraint is to use techniques based on the cross-correlations of the ambient noise in place in the structure. The idea is to take advantage of the elastic noise naturally present in the structure (due to engine vibrations or aero-acoustic turbulences on the fuselage of an aircraft for example) in order to avoid the emission of the elastic waves by the SHM system. The complexity of the embedded SHM system is therefore reduced. We present here studies of noise cross-correlation techniques that have been conducted with the aim of doing passive guided wave tomography of extended defects (such as corrosion) using an array of piezoelectric (PZT) transducers. Noise is generated by spraying compressed air on the surface of a thin aluminum plate. Passive measurements are compared to active signals to demonstrate the effectiveness of the cross-correlation technique. Experimental results which come from tomographic time-of-flight imaging algorithms will also be described. Finally, an extension of this technique using Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBG) optic sensors will be presented."/>

This approach consists in optimizing a function of these parameters, which is independent of the concentration profile. We experimentally establish in laboratory conditions (T = 22 °C), on a data set composed of seven different gases, that these features are suitable for chemical compounds identification. In particular, we obtain a higher classification rate than the traditional amplitudes of the signals during the steady state, and we show that the classification success rate can be increased by using both of them in conjunction with a feature subset selection heuristic. We also propose a method based on deconvolution and kernel regression to estimate the temporal concentration profile."/>

This issue is addressed in this work with the development of a multi-electrode array based on Boron Doped Diamond (BDD) electrodes coated with metal catalyst nanoparticles. A new physical deposition method of the nanoparticles was developed, which offers good stability in terms of electro-activity and adhesion. The sensor array was tested for the electrochemical detection of pesticides including paraoxon and imidacloprid with good discrimination between both samples. For safety reason, hydrogen peroxide was also used as an efficient redox stimulus to assess the capability of the array to operate in tap water. The detection threshold was in the order of 19 ×10-2μM and 33×10-2μM for paraoxon and imidacloprid, respectively, as measured by chronoamperometry. Chronoamperometric method demonstrated also the potential of the array to operate online directly in tap water through the detection of H2O2."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Pipe internal pressure measurement is of utmost importance in the oil &amp; gas industry to monitor the extraction process, and thus to prevent hydrate-plugs formation which may occur in specific temperature &amp; pressure conditions. Traditional solutions usually rely on pressure sensors in direct contact with the fluid to monitor, therefore requiring one hole per sensor, but they also weaken the pipe structure, which may prematurely lead to significant leaks. Attempts to develop non-intrusive pressure sensors relying, for instance, on acoustic waves detection or even strain measurements (the pipe wall acting, in some way, like the membrane of a traditional intrusive sensor), are up to now not fully satisfying, mainly due to poor temperature cross-sensitivity compensation. Thus, 1°C temperature compensation error typically leads for Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) transducers to pressure measurement biases greater than 26%@100 bar (e.g.: Ø4'' NPS Sch. 160 steel pipe). Consequently, if such non-intrusive, but biased, solutions could possibly have been considered to monitor, for instance, a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) primary coolant circuit, it was with the risk of dramatic consequences since the fluid can reach temperatures up to 320°C. On the other hand, the solution detailed here truly achieves to cancel the temperature cross-sensitivity, and potentially any additional effect on pressure measurement, provided that each effect has the same influence on all transducers. It first relies on a better understanding of the pipe behavior under hydrostatic pressure, supported by a dedicated model developed on purpose, which demonstrates that the internal pressure &amp; the surface temperature variations of a closed pipe can be recovered with at least two direction-sensitive transducers, the temperature dependence of the pressure measurement being simply removed by a straightforward compensation process. This paper explains the underlying principle, thanks to a formal model established with only few hypotheses, but extended to more complex field conditions. It ends with a lab-test validation involving FBG transducers attached to a pressure circuit submitted to temperature variations greater than several tens of °C, and concludes about the advantages &amp; limitations of this novel approach for non-intrusive sensing, and its potential extensions to other measurement techniques."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="This paper presents an autonomous instrument based on an array of 8 MEMS micro cantilevers for gas sensor application. The main contribution of this system to the MEMS domain lies on the way the micro cantilevers are optimally exposed to a constant gas flow in a gas cell where the electrical connections to the sensors are done without any wire-bonding. Sensors can therefore be easily changed for another application or for maintenance. Moreover, this complete and autonomous system is able to extract in real time (1 reading/sec) the frequency response of all the MEMS cantilevers by using an innovative mixed-signal processing circuit featuring self-diagnostic and automatic-calibration. Other novelties are the simultaneous piezo-electric excitation of the sensor-array, a low-noise polarization circuit and the detection circuit optimized for piezo-resistive micro cantilevers. From a system point of view this instrument provides the ability to monitor the frequency profiles of an array of resonant gas sensors."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="In the frame of the French trans-governmental R&amp;D program against chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosives (CBRN-E) threats, CEA is studying the detection of Special Nuclear Materials (SNM) by neutron interrogation with fast neutrons produced by an associated particle sealed tube neutron generator. The deuterium-tritium fusion reaction produces an alpha particle and a 14 MeV neutron almost back to back, allowing tagging neutron emission both in time and direction with an alpha particle position-sensitive sensor embedded in the generator. Fission prompt neutrons and gamma rays induced by tagged neutrons which are tagged by an alpha particle are detected in coincidence with plastic scintillators. This paper presents numerical simulations performed with the MCNP-PoliMi Monte Carlo computer code and with post processing software developed with the ROOT data analysis package. False coincidences due to neutron and photon scattering between adjacent detectors (cross talk) are filtered out to increase the selectivity between nuclear and benign materials. Accidental coincidences, which are not correlated to an alpha particle, are also taken into account in the numerical model, as well as counting statistics, and the time-energy resolution of the data acquisition system. Such realistic calculations show that relevant quantities of SNM (few kg) can be distinguished from cargo and shielding materials in 10 min acquisitions. First laboratory tests of the system under development in CEA laboratories are also presented."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="We propose a new concept for enhancing the fluorescence of ultrathin nanolayers. In this article, we address the issue of efficient absorption of polymer thin films with nanometer characteristics. For many applications, such as sensing, but also for lighting or photovoltaics, devices require the use of nanometer-sized films of a specific polymer or a luminescent nanolayer in general. Usually, most studies are geared toward enhancing the emission of such luminescent films via Bragg mirror-type cavities, for instance, but little attention is paid for optimizing the absorption of the thin films. We show the principle of gain-assisted waveguiding energy transfer (G-WET) by inserting a gain-active layer between an active nanometer-scale layer (a luminescent polymer in our case) and the passive substrate. Efficient absorption via “recycling” of the pumping photons is ensured by the waveguiding effect due to this high-index active layer. To demonstrate the G-WET effect, two kinds of samples were studied. They consist of extremely thin (∼10 nm) polymer nanolayers spin-coated either on quartz, referred as the passive case, or on a ZnO active thin film (∼170 nm, acting as a gain medium) grown on sapphire, referred as the active case. Samples were characterized by room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy under various pumping intensities. Compared to the quartz substrate, the ZnO thin film induces a remarkable enhancement of a factor ∼8 on the fluorescence of the polymer nanolayer. Observations show that, for the passive quartz substrate case, the PL of the spin-coated polymer rapidly saturates, defining a luminescence limit; whereas, with the active ZnO layer, the polymer presents a nonlinear PL intensity surpassing the saturation level. This new photonic system revealed that the polymer luminescence enhancement is the result of both an efficient energy transfer and a geometrical effect ensured by an evanescent coupling of the waveguided ZnO stimulated emission. Although our work discusses the specific organic–inorganic case of fluorescent polymer and ZnO, the G-WET concept can be generalized to any hybrid layered sample verifying the necessary energy transfer conditions discussed in this article, thus, demonstrating that this is of a special interest for efficient absorption and efficient recycling of the excitation photons for any nanometer scale fluorescent layer."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Nowadays, the safety of passengers on board is the first preoccupation for aircraft manufacturers. For this reason, next-generation helicopters are now being designed with a wide range of advanced technologies to reinforce safety. In this context, a new fire detection system based on reflectometry is proposed for monitoring the engines of helicopters. The main idea is to mesh engines by a fireproof cable that serves not only as a physical support of test signals, but also as a fire detection sensor. To do so, OMTDR technology is integrated into an electronic device analyzing in permanence the impedance variation of the sensor caused by a temperature increase. The proposed fire detection system permits not only to detect the fire as conventional systems, but also to locate it with accuracy. Moreover, the fire detection sensor becomes intelligent since it is able to self-diagnosis (i.e. hard fault, aging, etc.) thanks to OMTDR use. For feasibility proof, a demonstrator is developed and tested in laboratory. Experimental results show that the fire detection system is able to detect and locate multiple fire zones simultaneously without loss of accuracy."/>

This paper focuses on the selection and testing of singlemode (SM) optical fibers with limited RIA (Radiation Induced Attenuation) to be compliant with remote distributed instruments optical budgets, the ionizing radiation doses to sustain, and their reduction provided by the concrete basemat shielding. The tests aimed at exposing these fibers and the corresponding sensitive optical cables, to the irradiation doses expected during the normal operation of the reactor (up to 60 years for the European Pressurized Reactor), followed by a severe accident. Several gamma and mixed (neutron-gamma) irradiations were performed at CEA Saclay facilities: POSÉÏDON irradiator and ISIS reactor, up to a gamma cumulated dose of about 2 MGy and fast neutron fluence (E > 1 MeV) of 6 x 10$^{15}$ n/cm$^2$ . The first gamma test permitted to assess the RIA at various optical wavelengths, and to select three radiation tolerant singlemode fibers (RIA &lt; 5 dB/100 m, at 1550 nm operating wavelength). The second one was performed on voluminous strands of sensitive cables encapsulating the selected optical fibers, up to approximately the same accumulated dose, at two temperatures: 30°C and 80°C. A significant increase of the RIA, without any saturation tendency, appeared for fibers inserted into cables, correlated with the increase of the hydroxyl attenuation peak at 1380 nm. Molecular hydrogen generated by the radiolysis of compounds of the cable is at the origin of this phenomenon. A third gamma irradiation run permitted to measure the radiolytic hydrogen production yield of some compounds of a dedicated temperature cable sample. The efficiency of a carbon coating layer over the silica cladding, acting as a barrier against hydrogen diffusion, was also successfully confirmed. Finally, the efficiency of this carbon coating layer has also been tested under neutron irradiation, then qualified as a protection barrier against hydrogen diffusion in the optical fiber cores."/>

This requires roll-gap sensors able to measure this interaction under industrial rolling conditions and in real time in order to propose a feed-back control of process parameters. To reach these goals, this paper proposes a new roll-gap friction sensor based on an inverse method that interprets optical fiber Bragg gratings(FBG) strain measurements under the roll surface (fully embedded), which enables to evaluate contact stresses with very short computation times, compatible with real time interpretation. This elastic inverse method is analytical and relies on plane-strain and isothermal assumptions. The experimental apparatus is detailed, technical issues are clearly exposed as well as calibration procedures. Several pilot cold rolling tests have been performed at various rolling speeds and different strip thicknesses in order to demonstrate the industrial feasibility. Resulting evaluations of contact stresses are then compared with numerical simulations. Reasonable agreement is obtained for normal stress (i.e., pressure) but not for shear stress(only an order of magnitude is obtained)."/>

A polytopic formulation is introduced based on an accurate model of the mechatronic transmission. Then, a multi-model observer-based estimator is synthesized using root-clustering for exteroceptive variables estimation without additional position/force sensor.

The different chapters examine various stages that involve a number of robotic devices, particularly those designed for manipulation tasks characterized by mechanical flexibility. Chapter 1 deals with the general context surrounding the design of functionally integrated microgripping systems. Chapter 2 focuses on the dual notations of modal commandability and observability, which play a significant role in the control authority of vibratory modes that are significant for control issues. Chapter 3 presents different modeling tools that allow the simultaneous use of energy and system structuring notations. Chapter 4 discusses two sensorless methods that could be used for manipulation in confined or congested environments. Chapter 5 analyzes several appropriate approaches for responding to the specific needs required by versatile prehension tasks and dexterous manipulation. After a classification of compliant tactile sensors focusing on dexterous manipulation, Chapter 6 discusses the development of a complying triaxial force sensor based on piezoresistive technology. Chapter 7 deals with the constraints imposed by submicrometric precision in robotic manipulation. Chapter 8 presents the essential stages of the modeling, identification and analysis of control laws in the context of serial manipulator robots with flexible articulations. Chapter 9 provides an overview of models for deformable body manipulators. Finally, Chapter 10 presents a set of contributions that have been made with regard to the development of methodologies for identification and control of flexible manipulators based on experimental data."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Ion stopping experiments in plasma for beam energies of few hundred keV per nucleon are of great interest to benchmark the stopping-power models in the context of inertial confinement fusion and high-energy-density physics research. For this purpose, a specific ion detector on chemical-vapor-deposition diamond basis has been developed for precise time-of-flight measurements of the ion energy loss. The electrode structure is interdigitated for maximizing its sensitivity to low-energy ions, and it has a finger width of 100 μm and a spacing of 500 μm. A short single α-particle response is obtained, with signals as narrow as 700 ps at full width at half maximum. The detector has been tested with α-particle bunches at a 500 keV per nucleon energy, showing an excellent time-of-flight resolution down to 20 ps. In this way, beam energy resolutions from 0.4 keV to a few keV have been obtained in an experimental configuration using a 100 μg/cm2 thick carbon foil as an energy-loss target and a 2 m time-of-flight distance. This allows a highly precise beam energy measurement of δE/E ≈ 0.04%–0.2% and a resolution on the energy loss of 0.6%–2.5% for a fine testing of stopping-power models."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Environment perception is crucial for the safe navigation of vehicles and robots to detect obstacles in their surroundings. It is also of paramount interest for navigation of human beings in reduced visibility conditions. Obstacle avoidance systems typically combine multiple sensing technologies (i.e., LiDAR, radar, ultrasound and visual) to detect various types of obstacles under different lighting and weather conditions, with the drawbacks of a given technology being offset by others. These systems require powerful computational capability to fuse the mass of data, which limits their use to high-end vehicles and robots. INSPEX delivers a low-power, small-size and lightweight environment perception system that is compatible with portable and/or wearable applications. This requires miniaturizing and optimizing existing range sensors of different technologies to meet the user's requirements in terms of obstacle detection capabilities. These sensors consist of a LiDAR, a time-of-flight sensor, an ultrasound and an ultra-wideband radar with measurement ranges respectively of 10 m, 4 m, 2 m and 10 m. Integration of a data fusion technique is also required to build a model of the user's surroundings and provide feedback about the localization of harmful obstacles. As primary demonstrator, the INSPEX device will be fixed on a white cane."/>

In particular, guided wave tomography algorithms give a quantitative image of the residual thickness of the monitored structured, for example a corroded pipe. The idea is to use the dispersion curves to link a change in phase or group velocity to a change in thickness. The method developed at CEA-List includes an auto-calibration phase, eliminating the need of a baseline to work, therefore enabling its use in presence of varying environmental and operational conditions. One drawback of tomography techniques is that they need many sensors compared to more conventional algorithms such as RAPID or Delay and Sum. We propose here a passive version of tomography to limit its intrusiveness by using data obtained by post-processing the ambient elastic noise in the structure. This enables the use of Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBG) on optical fibers as ultrasonic sensors. The use of FBGs drastically reduces the burden of the system, as several gratings can be multiplexed on a single optical fiber. Furthermore, these sensors are suited for many applications because of their resistance to harsh conditions (extreme temperatures, explosive atmosphere, radiations…)."/>

It answers situations where the network contains a trusted third party (one or many trusted key management servers). Two of MIKEY-Ticket modes correspond to Kerberos and Otway-Rees key distribution protocols. Meanwhile, the general MIKEY-Ticket mode is a new key distribution scheme relying on six messages which are exchanged between the node initiating the protocol (Initiator), the Key Management Server (KMS) and the responding node (Responder). This general mode suffers from a risk of a Denial of Service (DoS) inherited from the protocol design. In this work, we first propose a new MIKEY-Ticket mode that solves the risk of DoS during the key establishment between the Initiator and the Responder. The security of our solution is evaluated with ProVerif, a protocol verification tool. Then, in the second part of the paper, we describe the application of our protocol to sensors in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="This study presents a review of the state-of-the-art and a novel classification of current vision-based localisation techniques in unknown environments. Indeed, because of progresses made in computer vision, it is now possible to consider vision-based systems as promising navigation means that can complement traditional navigation sensors like global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) and inertial navigation systems. This study aims to review techniques employing a camera as a localisation sensor, provide a classification of techniques and introduce schemes that exploit the use of video information within a multi-sensor system. In fact, a general model is needed to better compare existing techniques in order to decide which approach is appropriate and which are the innovation axes. In addition, existing classifications only consider techniques based on vision as a standalone tool and do not consider video as a sensor among others. The focus is addressed to scenarios where no a priori knowledge of the environment is provided. In fact, these scenarios are the most challenging since the system has to cope with objects as they appear in the scene without any prior information about their expected position."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="In this paper, a new approach is introduced for the selection of the most relevant sensors to monitor and diagnose soft faults in complex wired networks. Although reflectometry offers good results in point to point topology networks, it introduces ambiguity related to fault location in more complex wired networks. As a solution, distributed reflectometry method is used. However, several challenges are imposed, from the computing complexities and sensor fusion problems, to the energy consumption. In this context, the proposed method combines Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) method with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach. To do so, a distributed reflectometry approach is considered for a CAN BUS network where sensors perform their reflectometry measurements consecutively. The simulated TDR responses are then arranged into a database. With this database, a PCA model is developed and used to detect the existing soft faults. Coupled with statistical analysis based on Hotellings T 2 and squared prediction error, the most relevant sensors to monitor and diagnose the soft faults present in the network are highlighted with a high accuracy."/>

Cependant, le calendrier réglementaire imposé par le gouvernement Français en 2007 a considérablement modifié l'état du marché français de sorte que l'application médicale du produit OSL/FO est actuellement ré-orientée vers d'autres modalités de traitement manquant de dosimètres adaptés (projet ANR-INTRADOSE (2009-2011)).,The CODOFER Project (2007-2009), led under the ANR-TECSAN Call, was coordinated by CEA LIST, in partnership with IGR and the FIMEL company.

This study, combined with the results of clinical tests obtained within the European Project MAESTRO, has demonstrated the advantages of OSL/FO dosimetry for providing Quality Assurance of treatments. However, the French market for dosimetry has greatly changed as a result of the rules edicted by the French government in 2007. The OSL/FO product is now targeted for other treatment modalities lacking suitable dosimeters (ANR-INTRADOSE Project (2009-2011))."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Despite their high relative abundance in our Universe, neutrinos are the least understood fundamental particles of nature. In fact, the quantum properties of neutrinos emitted in experimentally relevant sources are theoretically contested and the spatial extent of the neutrino wavepacket is only loosely constrained by reactor neutrino oscillation data with a spread of 13 orders of magnitude. Here we present a method to directly access this quantity by precisely measuring the energy width of the recoil daughter nucleus emitted in the radioactive decay of beryllium-7. The final state in the decay process contains a recoiling lithium-7 nucleus, which is entangled with an electron neutrino at creation. The lithium-7 energy spectrum is measured to high precision by directly embedding beryllium-7 radioisotopes into a high-resolution superconducting tunnel junction that is operated as a cryogenic sensor. Under this approach, we set a lower limit on the Heisenberg spatial uncertainty of the recoil daughter of 6.2 pm, which implies that the final-state system is localized at a scale more than a thousand times larger than the nucleus itself. From this measurement, the first, to our knowledge, direct lower limit on the spatial extent of a neutrino wavepacket is extracted. These results may have implications in several areas including the theoretical understanding of neutrino properties, the nature of localization in weak nuclear decays and the interpretation of neutrino physics data."/>

In a previous work, we have fabricated diamond micro-cantilever sensors which have been coated with a sensitive layer. A gas analysis cell was developed to hold 8 sensors and allow them to be easily changed. A dedicated electronic read-out circuit provides low-noise detection of all sensors output signal. To complement this existing technology, we are designing a new system to accurately tune temperature and flow parameters of the analyzed gas. In parallel, micro-cantilever sensors have been optimized to increase sensor and gauge sensitivities."/>

Similar spectroscopic properties of thin films and solutions are observed. This is consistent with the absence of interactions between polymer side chains. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of PSt-NI studied in various solvents of different polarity are compared to the corresponding spectra of NI. The longest wavelength absorption of PSt-NI and NI is characterized by a band with a maximum wavelength around 410 nm. The peak position is sensitive to the polarity of the solvent, which is in agreement with the charge transfer character of the transition. The fluorescence spectrum of PSt-NI shows a maximum emission in chloroform at 515 nm and is red shifted compared to those of NI. Fluorescence lifetimes of PSt-NI and NI are measured in presence and absence of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and the results are interpreted via the Stern-Volmer analysis. In solution, the fluorescence quenching of NI is purely collisional, whereas both dynamic and static quenching are observed with PSt-NI Upon 1 minute exposure to DNT vapor, it was shown that a 5 nm thick film of PSt-NI exhibited a 45% drop in its fluorescence intensity, which makes this polymer very attractive for sensing applications."/>

Such thin probe, with a diameter below 150 µm, can be inserted directly into materials without disturbing the physical phenomena. Chirped FBGs are used to track the shock wave in the grating using wavelengths. The velocity (few km/s) and shock wave profile measurements are realized by recording the CFBG's reflected spectral width. Pressure measurements at few GPa levels use dynamic spectrometers, two approaches are compared: parallel acquisition using an Arrayed-Waveguide-Grating and time-multiplexing by wavelength-to-time conversion using dispersion."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) is a new and promising public key encryption that allows fine-grained authorization on data based on user attributes. Such property is favorable for multiple applications that require encrypted storage or access control on data, in particular: eHealth applications. However, ABE schemes are known not to be efficient in the encryption phase because ciphertext size and the time required to encrypt grow with the complexity of the access policy. Such drawback is critical in the context of pervasive computing, for instance, in the Internet of Things, where data producers are usually resource-constrained devices, e.g. smart phones or sensing platforms. In this work, we propose OEABE standing for Outsourcing mechanism for the Encryption of Ciphertext-Policy ABE (CP-ABE). We show how a user can offload expensive operations of CP-ABE encryption to a semi-trusted party in a secure manner. For illustration, we first conducted a performance estimation on an emulated Wismote sensor platform. Then, to demonstrate the performance gains of our mechanism, we implemented our proposal and did comparison to an existing implementation of CP-ABE on a laptop"/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Radiological detection where Cherenkov residual background can be prominent requires scintillators with increased emission wavelength. Cherenkov residual background precludes the use of UV-emitting sensors such as plastic scintillators. However, the literature is scarce in red-emitting plastic scintillators and only one commercial scintillator is currently available (BC-430, from Saint-Gobain Crystals and Detectors). In addition, X-ray imaging or Time-of-Flight Positron Emission Tomography (ToF-PET) applications are also demanding on this type (color) of scintillators, but only their scintillation decay time is fast, which is not particularly the case for BC-430. We present herein our latest developments in the preparation and the characterization of fast and red plastic scintillators for this application. Here &quot;fast&quot; means nanosecond range decay time and &quot;red&quot; is an emission wavelength shifted towards more than 550 nm. At first, the strategy to the preparation of such material is explained by decomposing the scintillator to fundamental elements. Each stage is then optimized in terms of decay time response, then the elemental bricks are arranged to give plastic scintillator formulations that are compatible with the abovementioned characteristics. The results are compared with the red-emissive BC-430 commercial plastic, and the ultra-fast, violet-emitting BC-422Q 1% plastic."/>

The mean size of the particles is in the order of 10 nm, as characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image processing and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The particles are made of e.g. platinum, iridium, gold, ruthenium or alloys thereof and showed good adhesion, and good electrochemical reactivity towards a wide range of redox analytes. Sensor arrays composed of 4 BDD electrodes each modified with a different nano-catalyst were mounted and tested for various analytical applications. For instance such a sensor array was able to detect online and discriminate the presence in tap water of the following contaminants: Imidacloprid, Dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) or hydrogen peroxide, chosen for demonstration purpose."/>

COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory tract and lungs. Therefore, analysis of exhaled breath could be an alternative scalable method for reliable SARS-CoV-2 screening. In the current study, an experimental protocol using an electronic-nose (‘e-nose’) for attempting to identify a specific respiratory imprint in COVID-19 patients was optimized. Thus the analytical performances of the Cyranose ® , a commercial e-nose device, were characterized under various controlled conditions. In addition, the effect of various experimental conditions on its sensor array response was assessed, including relative humidity, sampling time and flow rate, aiming to select the optimal parameters. A statistical data analysis was applied to e-nose sensor response using common statistical analysis algorithms in an attempt to demonstrate the possibility to detect the presence of low concentrations of spiked acetone and nonanal in the breath samples of a healthy volunteer. Cyranose ® reveals a possible detection of low concentrations of these two compounds, in particular of 25 ppm nonanal, a possible marker of SARS-CoV-2 in the breath."/>

However, they may suffer from speed divergence when the system is at rest as illustrated on Figure 1. In this paper we propose to tackle this issue. For that we investigate the detection of time epochs when a visual-inertial sensor rig is stationary. Two kind of stops are deduced from raw sensor data. SoftStop when the system is at rest with a slight movement noise (e.g a human at rest holding the system) and HardStop when the system is perfectly at rest (e.g a robot at rest holding the system). We propose an inertial detector and a visual detector to decide if the system is on move, on SoftStop or HardStop and describe how to take advantage of this additional information in a VISLAM. A significant accuracy gain and better robustness against divergence is demonstrated on our datasets."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Increased capabilities such as recognition and self-adaptability are now required from IoT applications. While IoT node power consumption is a major concern for these applications, cloud-based processing is becoming unsustainable due to continuous sensor or image data transmission over the wireless network. Thus optimized ML capabilities and data transfers should be integrated in the IoT node. Moreover, IoT applications are torn between sporadic data-logging and energy-hungry data processing (e.g. image classification). Thus, the versatility of the node is key in addressing this wide diversity of energy and processing needs. This paper presents SamurAI, a versatile IoT node bridging this gap in processing and in energy by leveraging two on-chip sub-systems: a low power, clock-less, event-driven Always-Responsive (AR) part and an energy-efficient On-Demand (OD) part. AR contains a 1.7MOPS event-driven, asynchronous Wake-up Controller (WuC) with a 207ns wake-up time optimized for sporadic computing, while OD combines a deep-sleep RISC-V CPU and 1.3TOPS/W Machine Learning (ML) for more complex tasks up to 36GOPS. This architecture partitioning achieves best in class versatility metrics such as peak performance to idle power ratio. On an applicative classification scenario, it demonstrates system power gains, up to 3.5x compared to cloud-based processing, and thus extended battery lifetime."/>

However, past detector developments with Bi absorbers were confronted with the low thermal conductivity of bismuth that degraded the energy resolution and deformed the detector response function (non-Gaussian energy peak). In the present study, we have investigated the performances of large bulk bismuth absorbers (1× 1× 0.16 mm3 ) thermally coupled to metallic magnetic sensors. Despite a very good baseline energy resolution, detectors with monolithic bismuth absorbers have degraded FWHM energy resolutions with any type of thermal coupling between the absorber and the sensor tested. In comparison tests with BiCu and BiAg bilayer absorbers demonstrated much better performances."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="Ce travail s’inscrit dans le cadre du contrôle de composants de forte épaisseur, en particulier dans l’industrie nucléaire. Les conditions de fonctionnement sévères (température, pression, irradiation…) peuvent être à l’origine de divers types de défauts mettant en jeu la sûreté des installations. Si les défauts volumiques sont aisément détectables, les fissures de faible ouverture orientées perpendiculairement aux surfaces accessibles pour le contrôle sont plus problématiques, plus particulièrement si elles sont localisées à coeur. Si elles ne sont pas détectées à temps, elles peuvent s’étendre selon l’épaisseur du composant et rompre l’étanchéité de ce dernier. Dans cette étude, on s’intéresse en particulier aux méthodes d’imagerie par ultrasons multiéléments de ces fissures dans des composants métalliques. L’objectif principal consiste à mettre au point une méthode de contrôle efficace de ces défauts à un stade précoce, tout en réduisant au minimum la durée du contrôle. La combinaison des contraintes de dimensions de défaut visé, nombre d’éléments du transducteur acceptable, et épaisseur des composants conduit à l’exploitation d’une configuration en transmission, dans laquelle on dispose une paire de capteurs multiéléments situés de part et d’autre de la pièce à inspecter, profitant de l’accessibilité de deux faces parallèles du composant. Des algorithmes d’imagerie basés sur l’émission d’ondes planes sont alors évalués, d’une part sur des données simulées à l’aide du logiciel CIVA, et d’autre part sur des données expérimentales sur une pièce en acier contenant des fissures électro-érodées dans toute son épaisseur. La couverture de zone atteignable dans une telle configuration est étudiée. Les algorithmes d’imagerie existant dans des configurations mono-capteur multiéléments sont étendus à la configuration en transmission, tout d’abord dans le domaine temporel (imagerie PWI), puis dans le domaine fréquentiel (imagerie fk), ce qui constitue une première étape vers une imagerie en temps réel de ces structures."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="An original method to build a visual model for unknown objects by a humanoid robot is proposed. The algorithm ensures successful autonomous realization of this goal by addressing the problem as an active coupling between computer vision and whole-body posture generation. The visual model is built through the repeated execution of two processes. The first one considers the current knowledge about the visual aspects and the shape of the object to deduce a preferred viewpoint with the aim of reducing the uncertainty of the shape and appearance of the object. This is done while considering the constraints related to the embodiment of the vision sensors in the humanoid head. The second process generates a whole robot posture using the desired head pose while solving additional constraints such as collision avoidance and joint limitations. The main contribution of our approach relies on the use of different optimization algorithms to find an optimal viewpoint by including the humanoid specificities in terms of constraints, an embedded vision sensor, and redundant motion capabilities. This approach differs significantly from those of traditional works addressing the problem of autonomously building an object model."/>

This allows the robot programmer to have a deterministic influence on the length of every sensing action. The proposed methodology is applied to localise a solid object in 3D using a Staubli RX90 robot equipped with a force-torque sensor coupled with a spherical end effector.

Three tilted FBGs, with respectively 0 degrees, 4 degrees and 8 degrees external tilt angles are annealed according to a conventional high temperature regeneration protocol. We monitor the evolution of distinct spectral features during the thermal annealing process. We also propose a method in order to follow the regeneration process of tilted FBG, without focusing on individual spectral resonances. Regeneration of tilted FBGs presents numerous interests for the realization of high temperature sensors and devices, but also to improve their resistance to preliminary manufacturing processes requiring high temperature steps."/>

For the fission fragments, data were also measured at different electric field strengths of the detector. Heavy ions have a significant pulse-height defect in CVD diamond material, which increases with increasing energy of the ions. It also depends on the electrical field strength applied at the detector. The measured pulse-height defects were explained in the framework of recombination models. Calibration methods known from silicon detectors were modified and applied. A comparison with data for the pulse-height defect in silicon detectors was performed."/>

The Random Demodulator (RD) has been chosen as the Analog-to-Information Converter (AIC) in the acquisition chain. The study focuses on the influence of RD's filter selection, signal length, and compression factors on signal recovery quality. The results demonstrate that reconstruction quality improves with longer signal lengths, and that the choice of low-pass filter type and order has minimal impact. The findings contribute to the enhancement of reflectometry systems based on Compressed Sensing."/>

The solutions are based on both long length SPNDs (Self Powered Neutron Detectors) and on distributed OFSs (Optical Fibre Sensors) capable to detect the onset of a severe accident, the corium pouring on the containment building concrete basemat, and its interaction with the concrete floor under the reactor vessel, until it spreads in the core catcher (EPR case). This paper mainly focuses on these last three detection targets achievable with distributed OFSs. It is based on the results of a Molten Core &amp; Concrete Interaction (MCCI) experiment, namely VULCANO, held in June 2018 with a concrete crucible equipped with overall ~ 180 m long optical fibre sensing cables. This small scale experiment (50 kg of prototypical corium) has demonstrated the ability of distributed OFSs to remotely provide useful data during the MCCI run: i) temperature profiles images up to about 580°C (single wavelength Raman DTS reflectometer) until cooling down to room temperature, ii) high spatial-resolution frequency shifts profiles, due to combined (non-selective) strain and temperature influences (Rayleigh OFDR and Brillouin reflectometers), and iii) cables lengths ablated by the corium on sections weakened by the temperature (Raman DTS, Rayleigh OFDR, telecom and photon counting reflectometers)."/>

So, innovations are clearly needed to strengthen instrumentations, which went inoperative during this nuclear accident as a consequence of power supply losses. Possible improvements concern materials and structures, which may be remotely monitored thanks to Optical Fiber Sensors (OFS). We detail topics involving OFS helpful for monitoring, in nominal conditions as well as during a severe accident. They include distributed sensing (Rayleigh, Raman, Brillouin) for both temperature sensing and structure monitoring as well as H2 concentration and ionizing radiation monitoring. For future plants, Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors are considered up to high temperature for sodium-cooled fast reactor monitoring. These applications can benefit from fiber advantages: sensor multiplexing, multi-km range, no risk-to-people, no common failure mode with other technologies, remote sensing, and the ability to operate in case of power supply lost in the NPP."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="In the safety analysis for the core of the 4th Generation Reactors, the Total Instantaneous Blockage (TIB) is a hypothetic accident scenario involving the melting of the blocked subassembly with a risk of propagation to the neighbouring subassemblies. To avoid this latter consequence a detection system has to scram the reactor. For Superphénix or EFR project a Delayed Neutron Detection Integrated (DND I) was considered as efficient to limit the melting to the first neighbouring subassemblies. Nonetheless for the CFV core the objective of improving the safety leads to limit the melting to the blocked subassembly. For this purpose, the CEA has launched a program development to find a new detection method. This paper provides a brief review of the feedback of R&amp;D, progress and program on the various early non-nuclear detection methods investigated by the CEA: • Temperature measurement at the subassemblies outlet by thermocouples. The advantage of this method is that it will require no additional instrumentation to that already present for continuous monitoring. • Temperature measurement at the subassemblies outlet by Optical Fibers Bragg Grating (OFBG). This technology has the electromagnetic immunity, compactness and short response time. • Temperature measurement at the subassemblies outlet by ultrasound. The measuring point is located closer to the head subassembly and the response time could be shorter. • Acoustic detection of sodium boiling. Boiling occurs early in the accident progress and the area to be monitored may be covered by few sensors. • Subassemblies loss of flow detection by eddy-current flowmeters. This method seems logically the easiest and the most immediate method to detect a blockage. To date, none of these methods has been fully demonstrated to be feasible. It should be noted that temperature measurement methods will probably consist of the detection of a low increase rate using specific signal processing. These methods have been compared according to their performance that may be expected and their maturity level. The shorter time to qualifying is for eddy-current flowmeters and thermocouples."/>

Millimetre to centimetre-sized defects are detected over areas of several squares meters with sparse sensor networks installed on metallic or composite structures. So far, the main drivers of the development of such technologies have been expectations of financial cost reduction and/or an increased safety. As monitoring requires complex cyber physical systems including, at least an energy source, sensors, data acquisition, treatment and communication capabilities, this paper targets for the first time the environmental assessment of GW-SHM. The analysis being use-case dependent, two prospective applications are studied: railroad monitoring and wind turbine monitoring. A complete GW-SHM system prototype is defined to quantify its environmental impact and exploitations scenarios are proposed to estimate the potential environmental gains provided by the monitoring. For the scenarios under consideration, the studied system is found to be either carbon neutral or carbon negative (i.e. favourable), but this result is limited to the functional units under consideration. The present study is expected to be a template for further environmental assessments of monitoring systems, which shall be conducted for each prospective applications and refined often as systems mature and exploitation scenarios become clearer."/>

At design level, M3D still suffers from a lack of commercial tools, especially for Place and Route, precluding the capability to provide signoff M3D GDS. In this paper, we introduce M3D-ADTCO, an architecture, design and technology co-optimization platform aimed at providing signoff M3D GDS. It relies on a M3D Process Design Kit and the use of a commercial Place and Route tool.

Second, it should serve as contact surface when force feedback is required. Therefore, we make use of 9 proximity sensors, 8 of which are placed around the finger in two planes, the last one being in front of it.

          <attvalue for="7" value="Traffic forecasting has attracted widespread attention recently. In reality, traffic data usually contains missing values due to sensor or communication errors. The Spatio-temporal feature in traffic data brings more challenges for processing such missing values, for which the classic techniques (e.g., data imputations) are limited: (1) in temporal axis, the values can be randomly or consecutively missing; (2) in spatial axis, the missing values can happen on one single sensor or on multiple sensors simultaneously. Recent models powered by Graph Neural Networks achieved satisfying performance on traffic forecasting tasks. However, few of them are applicable to such a complex missing-value context. To this end, we propose GCN-M, a Graph Convolutional Network model with the ability to handle the complex missing values in the Spatio-temporal context. Particularly, we jointly model the missing value processing and traffic forecasting tasks, considering both local Spatio-temporal features and global historical patterns in an attention-based memory network. We propose as well a dynamic graph learning module based on the learned local-global features. The experimental results on real-life datasets show the reliability of our proposed method."/>

The system was then tested for its ability to detect vapours of tobacco itself as well as other markers. The results were positive, a pattern of responses across the array was observed as each sensor gave a specific response towards different analytes. To determine the stability of these OBP biosensors over time, the sensors were repeatedly exposed to pulses of saturated D(+)-carvone vapour over three months. Little degradation was observed and these sensors were able to sensitively detect the target analytes after this period."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="A new method for the determination of skatole present in porcine adipose tissue samples utilizing the electrochemiluminescence of skatole is presented. It has been observed that oxygen radicals produced at a high cathodic voltage can react with oxidized skatole to create an excited intermediate molecule that then relaxes, generating peak photon emission at around 480 nm. A strong electrochemiluminescence or electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) signal using boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes was observed optimally when a reduction potential of −1.8 V was applied, held for 40 s, before holding an oxidation potential of 0.8 V for 10 s. Using this principle, a calibration curve using known concentrations of skatole showed good linearity (range 0.025−2 μM) and a very low detection limit (LOD, 0.7 nM). A method that demonstrates for the first time an approach that utilizes this ECL reaction, and has the potential to be developed into an analytical device for use in the slaughterhouse, has been developed. This was achieved by extracting skatole out of the porcine adipose tissues into acetonitrile-giving an extraction efficiency of 67.6%. This method was then validated by analyzing the skatole content of 33 pig fat samples that had been previously tested using a standard technique, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), containing a range of concentrations (0.02−2.58 μg/ g). This ECL method exhibited excellent reliability and correlation with HPLC, giving a R 2 coefficient of 0.911, thus demonstrating the potential for this method to be developed for an on-line skatole detector."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="We present WHODID: a turnkey intuitive web-based interface for fault detection, identification and diagnosis in production units. Fault detection and identification is an extremely useful feature and is becoming a necessity in modern production units. Moreover, the large deployment of sensors within the stations of a production line has enabled the close monitoring of products being manufactured. In this context, there is a high demand for computer intelligence able to detect and isolate faults inside production lines, and to additionally provide a diagnosis for maintenance on the identified faulty production device, with the purpose of preventing subsequent faults caused by the diagnosed faulty device behavior. We thus introduce a system which has fault detection, isolation, and identification features, for retrospective and on-the-fly monitoring and maintenance of complex dynamical production processes. It provides real-time answers to the questions: &quot; is there a fault? &quot; , &quot; where did it happen? &quot; , &quot; for what reason? &quot;. The method is based on a posteriori analysis of decision sequences in XGBoost tree models, using recurrent neural networks sequential models of tree paths. The particularity of the presented system is that it is robust to missing or faulty sensor measurements, it does not require any modeling of the underlying, possibly exogenous manufacturing process, and provides fault diagnosis along with confidence level in plain English formulations. The latter can be used as maintenance directions by a human operator in charge of production monitoring and control."/>

Depending on the properties of the sensor and on the application, the designer fits together different algorithms to process images. In the context of embedded devices, the hardware supporting those applications is very constrained in terms of power consumption and silicon area. Thus, the algorithms have to be compliant with the embedded specifications i.e. reduced computational complexity and low memory requirements. We investigate the opportunity to use the wavelet representation to perform good quality image processing algorithms at a lower computational complexity than using the spatial representation. To reproduce such conditions, demosaicing, denoising, contrast correction and classification algorithms are executed over several well known embedded cores (Leon3, Cortex A9 and DSP C6x). Wavelet-based image reconstruction shows higher image quality and lower computational complexity (3x) than usual spatial reconstruction. The use of wavelet decomposition also permits to increase the recognition rate of faces while decreasing computational complexity by a factor 25."/>

These are increasingly being used due to their integration of actuator and measuring functions. The general design context for these integrated systems has resulted in a complex and multi-disciplinary approach to the problem. This design exploits structures flexibility to respond to the challenges of robotic manipulation on a microworld scale. The design analysis approach is used in fields ranging from material sciences to advanced automatic control and topological structural optimization. In this chapter, the need for optimal design aid tools for these systems will be clearly highlighted and a range of existing optimization strategies will be examined. Finally, an illustrative example that focuses on the development of an optimal design software tool for flexible monolithic structures, will conclude the chapter. The structures are capable of maintaining actuator and sensor functions in a distributed and integrated form using piezoelectric materials."/>

The IoT describes a vision where heterogeneous objects like computers, sensors, Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID)tags or mobile phones are able to communicate and cooperate efficiently to achieve common goals thanks to a common IP addressing scheme. This paper focuses on the reliability of emergency applications under IoT technology. These applications' success is contingent upon the delivery of high-priority events from many scattered objects to one or more objects without packet loss. Thus, the network has to be selfadaptiveand resilient to errors by providing efficient mechanisms for information distribution especially in the multi-hop scenario. As future perspective, we propose a lightweight and energy efficientjoint mechanism, called AJIA (Adaptive Joint protocol based on Implicit ACK), for packet loss recovery and route quality evaluation in theIoT. In this protocol, we use the overhearing feature, characterizing the wireless channels, as an implicit ACK mechanism. In addition, the protocol allows for an adaptive selection of the routing path based on the link quality."/>

Gamma detection is required for illicit transportation of radioactive matter detection. Neutron detection is important to control nonproliferation of enriched material. Manufacturers worldwide propose sensors based on 3He which give the actual state of art in term of neutron detection. The price fluctuations due to the announcement of the shortage of 3He forces manufacturers to find viable alternative. From 10 years sensors providers have the challenge to replace previous 3He detectors that are known to be the most commonly deployed neutron sensor. As $^3$He detectors can only detect neutron, they must be completed with gamma detector. The proposed approach is based on pulse time correlation between adjacent sensors from signal collected by EJ200 plastic scintillators to detect gamma and neutron. Results obtained during FP7 Scintilla project test campaigns show the system relevance for replacement of today's $^3$He detectors."/>

Thanks to its many advantages, plastic scintillating fibers (PSF) is a good candidate for more accurate and personalized real-time dosimetry in computed tomography, and the company Fibermetrix has developed a new device named IVISCAN ® based on this technology. In this study, we evaluated performances of IVISCAN ® and associated uncertainties in terms of dose-rate dependence, angular dependence, stability with cumulative dose, repeatability, energy dependence, length dependence, and special uniformity in reference and clinical computed tomography beam qualities. For repeatability, the standard deviation is less than 0.039%, and the absolute uncertainty of repeatability lies between 0.017% and 0.025%. The deviation between IVISCAN ® and the reference regarding energy dependence is less than 1.88% in clinical use. Dose rate dependence results show a maximum deviation under ±2%. Angular dependence standard deviation σ is 0.8%, and the absolute uncertainty was 1.6%. We observed 1% of variation every 50 Gy steps up to a cumulative dose of 500 Gy. Probe response was found to be independent of the PSF length with a maximum deviation ∆D size &lt; 2.7% between the IVISCAN ® probe and the 1 cm PSF probe. The presented results demonstrated that IVISCAN ® performances are in accordance with metrology references and the international standard IEC61674 relative to dosemeters used in X-ray diagnostic imaging and then make it an ideal candidate for real-time dosimetry in CT applications."/>

However, their intrinsic activity is often challenging to investigate unambiguously with conventional methodologies due to the inherent complexities of such systems and the material itself. Zooming into the material and gaining electrochemical information with high resolution is a way to get rid of many experimental factors that influence the catalytic activity in macro-scale measurements. Herein, we employ nano-scale scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) to investigate individual catalyst agglomerates with and without Nafion content. The intrinsic ORR activity of the catalyst was unravelled by using a unique approach of normalizing the data of all measured points by their distinctive electrochemical surface area (ECSA). When coupling with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the structure and morphology of the catalytically active agglomerates were visualized"/>

The deployed fault location platform is based on a very sensitive and precise acquisition system which is capable of capturing perturbations or events on a dedicated portion of a given MV network. Thanks to a post processing algorithm based on the tenets of time reversal theory, FasTR method, an accurate localization of relevant events can be worked. Due to the fact that each acquisition system shares a clock reference based on a GPS antenna, the localization accuracy is within tens of meters. To the best of the Authors knowledge, this is the first time that the FasTR-based fault location technique is validated through live tests. The pilot network is a three branch system part of live radial MV distribution feeder consisting of a total of 2.6 km long underground three-phase cables. The branched lines are composed of coaxial cables of different types. The tests involve solid- and resistive-type single-phase-to-ground fault occurrences triggered along one of the laterals when the network is operational. The obtained results demonstrated the capacity of an on-deck portable system to make an on-line accurate detection of transient faults in a complex network."/>

A usual solution to prevent privacy violation relies on the use of pseudonyms as sensor identities; however, pseudonyms may deter authentication and access control enforcement in the network.

The force sensitive part is a tencentimeter long macroscopic capillary tube used as a levitating seismic mass. This tube presents a naturally stable equilibrium state with six degrees of freedom thanks to the combination of diamagnetic repulsive and magnetic attractive forces. It is only used as a one-direction force sensing device along its longitudinal axis. This force sensor is passive. The force measurement is based on the displacement of the capillary tube and in steady-state this displacement is proportional to the force. This sensor is characterized by an under-damped second-order linear force-displacement dynamic which remains linear on several hundred micrometers and can thus measure a wide range of microforces. Because of the magnetic springs con guration used, the capillary tube presents a horizontal mechanical sti ness that can be adjusted between 0.01 and 0.03 N/m (similar to the sti ness of a thin AFM cantilever). The measurement range typically varies between 50 N. Bandwidth is 4 Hz. The resolution depends on the sensor used to measure the capillary tube displacement and on noises induced by environmental conditions (ground and air vibrations). The resolution typically reached with a STIL confocal chromatic sensor is 5 nN inside a test chamber located on a anti-vibration table. This study is illustrated by a pull-off force measurement."/>

The latter required a particular process with adapted printing strategy and an interruption of the procedure in order to place the sensor. The impact of these modifications on the parts mechanical properties needs to be investigated in order to determine the influence of the sensor insertion on the mechanical parts behaviors.

In this context, this paper proposes a distributed parameters model for the lossy transmission line of a stranded UTP cable including the pitch of twist and frequency dependent effects to evaluate as faithfully as possible the reflectometry response in such cables. The developed model is validated with 3D-electromagnetic simulations using Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR). For online diagnosis, Orthognal Multi-Tone Time Domain Reflectometry is performed thanks to its capacity to control bandwidth and enable sensors fusion.

CoMN2 relies on a new concept called network mapping which consists in partitioning the network into several regions of increasing criticality. The criticality is set according to the energy, the traffic distribution and the deployment of nodes. Using this network mapping, our solution CoMN2 ensures the continuous network activity by efficiently swapping nodes from low critical area to highly critical area when required. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of our approach and show that the obtained improve-ment in terms of lifetime is in the order of 40%."/>

Fine grain Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling approaches are usually implemented in order to meet these conflicting objectives. Moreover, these techniques can be improved if local and on-the-fly monitoring of the dynamic variations is performed. A low-cost onchip general purpose sensor associated with an appropriate data fusion technique has been recently developed in order to monitor local temperature and voltage conditions. However, reliability has become a major concern as the technology scales below 40nm. The aging variation is not anymore negligible and must be taken into account during the monitor design and operation. This paper revisits such a sensor under both BTI and HCI aging effects in 28nm STMicroelectronics technology. A simple recalibration method is also proposed to mitigate the aging effects on the VT estimation."/>

In such applications, usual surface instrumentations cannot be set up because of high building density in many overcrowded cities. Tunnelling deals with the challenge of requiring ground surface undisturbed. One original concept proposed in the framework of the European Tunconstruct project, consists in very early settlement detection close to the tunnel vault and before any detectable effect on the surface. The adopted solution is to set-up a sensing element inserted into a directional drilling excavated above the foreseen tunnel. The methodology is based on the well known Brillouin Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (B-OTDR) in singlemode optical fibres and a special cable design dedicated to bending measurement. Two cables, based on different industrial manufacturing processes, have been developed taking into account the strain sensitivity required, the flexibility and the robustness for borehole installation, a low power attenuation and storage on a drum. Industrial prototypes have been manufactured and validated with tests in open air where settlement profiles geometry can be accurately controlled. Demonstration on job site took place on The Greater Cairo Metro Line 3 (CML3) at the beginning of 2009."/>

The demonstration is based on a simple model of the SHWFS, taking into account the microlens array as a whole and linking the SHWFS to the multilateral shearing interferometry family. This allows for estimating the quality of these additional derivatives, paving the way to new reconstruction techniques involving more than two cross derivatives that should improve the signal-to-noise ratio.,Le but de cet article est de montrer que l'analyseur de front d'onde Shack-Hartmann (SHWFS) permet d’accéder à plus de dérivées que les deux dites classiques (selon x et y), qui sont extraites soit par recherche des barycentres (centroiding), soit en utilisant les deux premières harmoniques de la transformée de Fourier de l'image de l'analyseur. La démonstration se base sur un modèle simple du SHWFS qui prend en compte un réseau de microlentilles en tant qu'un objet et lie par similarité le SHWFS au concept d'interférométrie à décalage multi-latéral.

Moreover, such a protocol is strictly required to have low computational and communication overhead as well as small memory footprint. Would there be a protocol which meets these requirements' We answer this question positively by introducing a novel time synchronization protocol whose main component is &quot; adaptive-value tracking &quot;. Thanks to this component , each sensor node synchronizes the rate of its clock to that of a reference clock through successive feedbacks with a considerably low computational and memory overhead. By adjusting time offset of the rate-synchronized clocks, the network-wide synchronization is established even without demanding rapid propagation of the reference clock and keeping track of the neighboring nodes. In the light of our experimental evaluation in a testbed of 20 MICAz sensor nodes, we observed that the proposed protocol provides similar synchronization under the same communication frequency with an approximately 97% less CPU overhead and 80% less memory allocation compared to the recent flooding based time synchronization protocols in WSNs.

Such materials provide an advantage over conventional fabrication techniques due to higher compressive, flexural, and tensile strengths. Yet, one challenge with fiber reinforcement is presence of unintended alignment during fabrication, which may deviate the material's strength from its intended design. This anisotropy needs to be nondestructively quantified to validate the material design post-fabrication. While electromagnetic nondestructive testing sensors have been demonstrated for quantifying the characteristics of ferromagnetic fibers in a material, there has not been a robust study on quantifying anisotropy with such systems. In this work, we provide the fundamental theory and process for quantifying anisotropy in steel fiber reinforced resins using electromagnetic sensors, with our data achieving a 95% goodness-of-fit with our theoretical model, on average."/>

Our system is able to automatically make the decision to generate specialised code and use it each time an improvement is observed in application performance. In the Internet of Things (IoT), devices usually have limited precision; our system adapts to theses devices decreasing precision in order to increase performance. We evaluate our system on floating point multiplication using the WisMote platform, where the specialised code executes more than 7 times faster than generic code, all overheads included. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that a runtime code generation system is used to automatically optimise code in such constrained devices as WSN nodes."/>

It introduces a novel computational method leveraging the Serial Ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM) architecture, along with the Computational SRAM concept, and will be called Compute-In-Place (CIP). This exploration of CIP Serial FeRAM reveals its potential for improving predictability, energy efficiency and security in high-throughput processing of large volumes of sensor data. Unlike conventional computing architectures, CIP Serial FeRAM lightens the MCU's computational load, reduces latency and improves energy efficiency by enabling computational tasks within memory.

In this work, we integrate the development process of I&amp;C systems and the involvement of stakeholders within a model-driven methodology. The proposed approach introduces a new architectural framework that defines various concepts, allowing system implementations and encompassing different development phases, all actors, and system concerns. In addition, we define a new I&amp;C Modeling Language (ICML) and a set of methodological rules needed to build different architectural framework views. To illustrate this methodology, we extend the specific use of an open-source system engineering tool, named Eclipse Papyrus, to carry out many automation and verification steps at different levels of abstraction. The architectural framework modeling capabilities will be validated using a realistic use case system for the protection of nuclear reactors. The proposed framework is able to reduce the overall system development cost by improving links between different specification tasks and providing a high abstraction level of system components."/>

It is a main part of the predictive maintenance strategy that can help to enhance the reliability and availability of industrial systems while reducing unscheduled downtime and maintenance cost. Applying fault prognostics to industrial systems is difficult because very few sequences about degradation are available. Hence, this paper proposes a new approach able to perform the fault prognostics when few historical degradation data are available. In offline, a library of Health Indicators (HIs) and library of adaptive models are defined. Then, the best HI-model pairs according to the accuracy of the a priori sequences are selected. In online, several RULs are predicted for the new sequence using the selected pairs. After that, the final RUL is computed by merging the RULs using a weighted mean. The approach is validated using a degradation scenario selected from an aircraft engine degradation dataset (CMAPSS dataset). The obtained results are promising compared to some well-known similar state-of-the-art approaches."/>

Using electric measurements only, the approach feeds back pre-touch forces and torques to the operator through an haptic interface. These forces and torques are generated by a set of virtual electric charges and dipoles arranged on the probe and reacting in the electric field reflected by the objects. This model of emulated forces is passive and guarantees the stability of a position-position haptic feedback loop. The whole approach is assessed through a set of experiments carried out on a Cartesian slave robot coupled to an haptic interface. The obtained results show the feasibility of the concept and its robustness to different configuration of objects. Such an electro-haptic feedback opens new perspectives in both electric field sensing and underwater robotics."/>

In this paper, we propose a nonlinear DR approach enforcing projection constraints resulting from an a priori knowledge about the structure of the data in multivariate periodical time series. We then propose several ways of exploiting this constrained projection to extract user-relevant information, such as the nominal behavior of a periodical dynamical system or the deviant behaviors which may occur at different time scales. The techniques are demonstrated on both a synthetic dataset composed of simulated multivariate data exhibiting a periodical behavior, and a real dataset corresponding to six months of sensor data acquisitions and recordings inside experimental buildings"/>

Since 2009 we are involved in a large program to build a camera consisting of a 2x2 mosaic of 32x32 pixel matrices using this sensor type. Since we rely on very similar approach of ASTRO-H/ITOMI design, we have concentred our efforts on the use of collective all-silicon technologies only. We have already presented the building block such as thermometers, sensors and cryo-electronics. Now, thanks to our new 32x32 CAD, we are today in the process of building 4 32x32 matrices per wafer. ASTRO-H/SXS uses degenerated Si as output wiring of the pixel and an HgTe semi-conductor absorber. Thanks to the use of superconducting wiring and composite superconducting Tantalum absorber, we hope to enhance the spectral resolution of this matrix onto that of SXS. Moreover, our development benefits of an ultra low power consumption Cryo-Electronics chain. This chain is based on High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs, with an AsGa/AlAsGa hetero-junction) and SiGe ASICs, and handles 34:1 multiplexing. It has been successfully tested under cryogenic conditions. The composite Tantalum absorber have been tested with 6keV X-rays, and our M.I.S. exhibit good and homogeneous sensitivity. To be compatible with the 1 mu W@50mK thermal budget allowed in present day spatial cryo-coolers, we have also developed new thermal insulation techniques that will allow us to easily handle more than 4000 independent pixels within this tiny power budget."/>

A global model performs sub-models simulating the various phenomena taking place at different spatial and temporal scales (crack growth, AE source and radiation, wave propagation in the structure, reception by sensors). In this context, accurate modelling of sensors behaviour must be developed. These sensors generally consist of a cylindrical piezoelectric element of radius approximately equal to its thickness, without damping and bonded to its case. Sensors themselves are bonded to the structure being tested. Here, a multiphysics finite element simulation tool is used to study the complex behaviour of AE sensor.

This paper considers the exploitation of devices, either routers and/or hosts, links diversity (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PLC, etc.) as an already pertinent mean to provide energy awareness in home network operations. In this paper, we focus on the design of an IPv6 energy-efficient routing protocol for such complex home networks. Our solution first enhances the OSPF core network routing protocol with a relevant energy metric that reflects the energy consumption of home network links technologies. We further expand the Neighbor Discovery protocol with an interface selection mechanism through two new options ELCO (Energy Link Cost Option) and EPCO (Energy Path Cost Option). This mechanism enables the selection of the most energy-efficient end-to-end path. Our approach is evaluated and compared with conventional routing protocols through real experimentations. The results show that significant energy savings can be reached when using our routing protocol."/>

This call is motivated by concerns that social touch is in a crisis signaled by a decline in social touch over the past 2 decades, the problematics of inappropriate social touch, and the well documented impact of a lack of social touch on communication, relationships, and well-being and health. These concerns shape how social touch enters the digital realm and raise questions for how and when the complex space of social touch is mediated by technologies, as well the societal implications. The paper situates the manifesto in the key challenges facing haptic designers and developers identified through a series of interdisciplinary collaborative workshops with participants from computer science, design, engineering, HCI and social science from both within industry and academia, and the research literature on haptics. The features and purpose of the manifesto form are described, along with our rationale for its use, and the method of the manifesto development. The starting points, opportunities and challenges, dominant themes and tensions that shaped the manifesto statements are then elaborated on. The paper shows the potential of the manifesto form to bridge between HCI, computer science and engineers, and social scientists on the topic of social touch."/>

The integral of this pulse is equal to the total amount of charge created by the photon in the detector, which is linearly related to the photon energy. Because the inter-arrival of photons can be shorter than the charge collection time, pulses corresponding to different photons may overlap leading to a phenomenon known as pileup. The distortions on the photon energy spectrum estimate due to pileup become worse when the photon rate increases, making pileup correction techniques a must for high counting rate experiments. In this paper, we present a novel technique to correct pileup, which extends a method introduced in \cite{hall:park:2004} for the estimation of the service time from the busy period in M/G/$\infty$ models. It is based on a novel formula linking the joint distribution of the energy and duration of the cluster of pulses and the distribution of the energy of the photons. We then assess the performance of this estimator by providing an expression of its integrated square error. A Monte-Carlo experiment is presented to illustrate on practical examples the benefits of the pileup correction."/>

One of the main features of CE$\nu$NS is its cross section, around two orders of magnitude higher compared with the inverse $\beta$ decay. BASKET (Bolometers At Sub keV Energy Threshold) project aims at investigating cryogenic calorimeters for the CE$\nu$NS detection, able to maintain the background level below the expected signature while being operated in above ground conditions in close vicinity to a nuclear reactor. The main requirements for such detectors are a low enough energy threshold of O(10 eV), and a fast signal rise time in the range of 0.1–1 ms to achieve good timing resolution and hence good mitigation of pile-up events. In this article, we report on the frst tests of a prototype detector coupling a Li$_$2WO$_4$ crystal to a magnetic metallic calorimeter (MMC) thermal sensor"/>

This method is very effective for canonical geometries such as planes or cylinders since the analytical expressions of Green’s dyads are known. This approach requires three steps: the computation of the quasi-static fields induced by the probe in the workpiece without flaw, the determination of the interaction between the primary field and the defect and finally, the calculation of the response of the eddy current sensor, resulting from this interaction. In order to generalize this approach to more complex configurations, in this paper, we focus on the first step: the computation of quasi-static fields induced by an eddy current probe in a conductor with a rough surface. The semi-analytical model we generalize here is based on Maxwell’s equations, written in a nonorthogonal coordinate system resulting in the writing of the boundary conditions at the interface by using a simple analytical expression. Starting from the second-order vector-potential formalism dedicated to non-orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems, two scalar potentials are expressed as a modal expansion, satisfying the outgoing wave condition. Finally, the coefficients of the modal expansion are determined by applying boundary conditions at the complex interface. First numerical results, obtained considering a specific configuration, are compared to other Finite Element data."/>

Everyone agrees that a great part of the energy consumed by industry and households can be saved. The energy savings can take many forms. In addition to the necessity to build equipments more and more energy efficient, it is also necessary to get a clear view of how the energy is used. This obviously involves the implementation of an energy flow measuring system for long lasting optimization solutions. It is precisely in this context that the project CHIC (Low cost industry utilities monitoring systems for energy savings), funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR), emerged. The objective of this project is to develop and test low-cost non-intrusive sensors to monitor and analyze the energy consumption of major flows used in the manufacturing sector (electricity, gas, compressed air). With such sensors, it should be possible to tool up a factory, equipment by equipment, which is not feasible with intrusive sensors. The ultimate goal is the long term consumption monitoring and the detection of the consumption deviations rather than a precise measurement. The measurement accuracy is fixed to 5%. These developments are based on the recent approaches in system identification and parametric estimation. This project, concretely, involves the design of new low-cost sensors in the following areas: current sensors, voltage, power, and gas flow, relying on the international ISO 50001 standard for Energy Management Systems. The work presented in this chapter focuses on the modeling of the gas flow supplied to a boiler in order to implement a soft sensor. This implementation requires the estimation of a mathematical model that expresses the flow rate from the control signal of the solenoid valve and the gas pressure and temperature measurements. Two types of models are studied: LPV (Linear Parameter Varying) model with pressure and temperature as scheduling variables and a non-parametric model based on Gaussian processes."/>

Damages could occur on these parts and their monitoring is required for the safety of users. A Structural Health Monitoring system composed by a Lamb’s waves generator and a sensor is a privileged candidate to detect such damages. The flexibility of composite manufacturing allows the integration of such a system. The topic of this study is to optimize the integration of a Structural Health Monitoring system in aircraft structural parts. The present article focuses on the optimization of the integration method of a piezoelectric Lead Zirconate Titanate transducer into laminated composite (Carbon/Epoxy), cured in autoclave according to aircraft manufacturing requirements. The health state of the integrated transducer with three connecting methods is evaluated using X-ray scanning. Punctual stress is responsible for the crack of the transducer occurred during composite curing. The connecting method with aluminum sheet and silver joint is selected because it minimizes local stresses and keeps the transducer integrity. The cohesion between the integrated transducer and the host material is observed by optical microscopy, it shows the presence of void zones located in the PZT edges. A Laser Doppler Vibrometer scanning shows the ability of the integrated piezoelectric transducer to generate Lamb waves."/>

A key feature of this structure is the possibility of conducting measurements in liquid environments while keeping high dynamic performances. The structure indeed provides a steady area that can be adapted so that suspension or adherent cells can be placed in a culture medium. The steady area is also connected to two adjacent beam resonators. Because these resonators never need to be immersed into the culture medium during measurements, forces applied to cells can be estimated with a high sensitivity via frequency shifts. In this paper, we conduct an extensive theoretical analysis to investigate the nonlinear effects of large static pre-deflections on the dynamic behavior of the structure. As a proof of concept, we also report the fabrication, characterization and calibration of the first prototype intended to deal with suspension cells with a diameter ranging from 100 to 500 μm. This prototype currently offers a quality factor of 700 and a force sensitivity of ∼2.6 HzmN−1. We also demonstrate that the prototype is capable of measuring the elastic modulus of biological samples in a rapid and sufficiently accurate manner without the need of a descriptive model."/>

Past researches usually assume that each person will respond equally to assistance and therefore do not update their assistance policy online. However, since the focus of our work is on humans in pHRC, intra- and inter-individual variations are to be considered. Thus, we propose a new hybrid approach that combines reinforcement learning and a symbolic approach based on an ontology to guide humans towards skills improvement using solely internal robot data without any additional sensor. The advantage of this combination is to handle constant adaptation of users needs while reducing the learning process. This reduction is insured by the use of a knowledge base to choose the most suitable assistance, as well as a pre-training of the learning algorithm in simulation. In addition, including human feedback in the learning algorithm speeds up learning and ensures that unwanted assistance is not provided to the operator. Finally, since acquiring a skill involves both theory and practice, we offer two types of assistance, textual advice, along with a change of the robot behavior. We have demonstrated through simulations and a real-world experimentation that our approach leads the learner more quickly to the mastery of skills and thus eases the on-the- job training."/>

The purpose of our solution is to leverage usage of mobile applications requiring large data transfers by channeling the traffic to a few, socially selected important users in the network called VIP delegates. The proposed VIP selection strategies are based on social network properties and are compared to the optimal solution (that covers 100% of users with minimum number of VIPs).

In addition to the characteristics of the fuel ejected from the rod after the clad failure, the fuel behaviour before the clad failure is still to be investigated, especially its fragmentation and its possible relocation within the rod during the clad ballooning phase. Furthermore, the chronology and the sequencing of these phenomena is of particular interest. For this purpose, the VINON-LOCA program, lying in the framework of a trilateral agreement between EDF, Framatome and CEA, is aimed at performing Out-Of-Pile heating tests on irradiated repressurized fuel rods, reproducing a typical Loss Of Coolant Accident thermal sequence. The VINON-LOCA experimental set-up is located in the so-called VERDON lab of the LECA-STAR hot cell complex. This lab was dedicated to the VERDON-ISTP program [3]. The VINON-LOCA set-up is thus largely instrumented for addressing not only these FFRD topics, but also Fission Gas Release (FGR), combining both online measurement (gamma stations, gamma camera, acoustic sensor, pressure, temperatures, flow meters, microGC…), and preand post-test characterization (gamma scanning, tomography, metrology, fuel fragments weighing and sieving, gas analyses…). An extensive and substantial qualification campaign has been performed to validate the furnace design regarding the desired test conditions, and to qualify the instrumentation. Following some preliminary modelling and calculations, it has included tests on an out-of-cell twin mockup and tests on dummy inactive rods in the hot cell. This allowed achieving successfully the first experimental qualification test of the program end of 2019 on an irradiated UO2 fuel rodlet. A second irradiated experiment is planned with increased instrumentation capabilities, notably a 2D gamma camera for online fuel motion detection."/>

According to the Shapiro-Moffette ternary diagram and depending on local partial pressures of H$_2$ , air, and water vapor, deflagration/detonation may occur with potential deleterious impact over equipment and structures. CO and CO$_2$ are also of interest, as revealing gases for MCCI. Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) of French Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) are equipped with passive autocatalytic recombiners (PARs), partly mitigating the H$_2$ risk. However, the H$_2$ -risk management strategy may be significantly improved by performing in situ monitoring of H$_2$ , O$_2$ , N$_2$ , H$_2$O, CO, and CO$_2$ partial pressures at several locations inside the containment, to account for potential local combustion risk. Raman spectrometry (RS) involves only one laser and spectrometer equipped with a 2-D charge-coupled device (CDD). Raman probes are chemically selective and may be radiation-hardened. Custom-made fiber-coupled Raman probes, linked with a readout unit, were qualified in a climatic chamber, a flame-propagation tube, a $^{60}$Co irradiation cell, a 3-D shaking table, a steam jet and the MISTRA facility (1/10 reduced-scale containment mock-up dedicated to thermo-hydraulic tests)."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="The complexity of modern embedded systems increases as they incorporate new concerns such as distribution and mobility. These new features need to be considered as early as possible in the software development lifecycle. Model Driven Engineering (MDE), that promotes an intensive use of models and is now widely seen as a solution to master the development of complex systems such as embedded ones. Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) is another major trend that gains acceptance in the embedded world due to its properties such as reuse, modularity and flexibility. This article proposes the Flex-eWare Component Model FCM for designing and implementing modern embedded systems. The FCM unifies MDE and CBSE and has been evaluated in several application domains with different requirements: wireless sensor networks, distributed client/server applications, and control systems for electrical devices. This approach highlights a new concept: flexibility points, that arise at several stages of the development process: in the model (design phase), in the execution platform and during the execution itself. This flexibility points are captured with model libraries that can extend the Flex-eWare Component Model."/>

          <attvalue for="7" value="This article proposes the design of an automatic classifier using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) along with machine learning techniques for identifying the five most important types of events of the Ubinas volcano, the most active volcano in Peru. The proposed method uses attributes from temporal, spectral and cepstral domains, extracted from the EMD of the signals, as well as a set of pre-processing and instrument correction techniques. Due to the fact that multichannel sensors are currently being installed in seismic networks worldwide, the proposed approach uses a multichannel sensor to perform the classification, contrary to the usual approach of the literature of using a single channel. The presented method is scalable to use data from multiple stations with one or more channels. The principal component analysis (PCA) method is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vector and the supervised classification is carried out by means of several machine learning algorithms, the support vector machine (SVM) providing the best results. The presented investigation was tested with a large database that has a considerable number of explosion events, measured at the Ubinas volcano, located in Arequipa, Peru. The proposed classification system achieved a success rate of more than 90%."/>
